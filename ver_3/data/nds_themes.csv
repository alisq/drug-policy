It is put in place before the risk is manifested and seeks to reduce the likelihood that an adverse shock will affect the health, quality of life and well-being of individuals, households and communities. {Política Nacional Para La Reduccíon Del Consumo De Sustancias Psicoactivas Y Su Impacto, 2007, p.19} ~ Since the goal of the prevention axis is to prevent/avoid the onset and abuse of psychoactive substances at any point in the life cycle, it is necessary to operate on contextual, situational, family and individual conditions or variables that increase risk and vulnerability to the onset and maintenance of licit and illicit substances use. In particular, those that are more predictive of the risk and those that can be intervened with the resources that have or can be enhanced. In the scenario of prevention as risk management, ""legal"" and illicit ""drugs"" exist, so it is necessary to offer the means to ""live"" with them by choosing not to experiment with licit substances at an early stage and, if they come into contact with them, that they do not try the illicit ones (prevention). If they are still in contact with them, that they do not move to patterns that are even more harmful to health and well-being (mitigation and improvement). {Política Nacional Para La Reduccíon Del Consumo De Sustancias Psicoactivas Y Su Impacto, 2007, p.19} ~ The micro-social level aims to work on risk and protection factors from socialization domains fundamental to the individual: the family, the school, the social reference group (peers) and the community in general. Strategies refer to the development and strengthening of the family, fundamental not only because it is a socializing medium par excellence, but also because exogenous crises are recreated inside, reflecting the risk and vulnerability of the environment and weakening its socializing capacities. {Política Nacional Para La Reduccíon Del Consumo De Sustancias Psicoactivas Y Su Impacto, 2007, p.20} ~ Other strategies refer to the construction of support networks in all the vital areas of development of subjects. The Policy recognizes that these are ideal scenarios for the development of prevention, but it also urges a revision of the perspective that limits, for example, the school to being an ""ideal"" ground for prevention, in order to return to its essential role as a socializing sphere and as a constitutive part of the social support network of children, adolescents, families and communities. {Política Nacional Para La Reduccíon Del Consumo De Sustancias Psicoactivas Y Su Impacto, 2007, p.20} ~ However, it is necessary to overcome the ""problematic"" vision of the young person (as proposed by the National Youth Policy), which distances itself from the subject's understanding and knowledge, indispensable for building a shared vision of the world and transforming reality. {Política Nacional Para La Reduccíon Del Consumo De Sustancias Psicoactivas Y Su Impacto, 2007, p.20} ~ The proposed strategies refer to the promotion of personal development and resilience, as well as to the creation of information and service networks, prioritizing social protection to children, adolescents and young people in vulnerable conditions, strengthening formal and informal mechanisms of protection, as well as social networks. This not only seeks to create support environments, but also to provide concrete means for better risk management, free access from barriers for groups with the greatest need. {Política Nacional Para La Reduccíon Del Consumo De Sustancias Psicoactivas Y Su Impacto, 2007, p.20} ~ In order for the strategies and actions of the prevention operative axis to consolidate the fulfillment of the goal, one must: 1) know the reality to be transformed, 2) involve stakeholders in all phases of the process, 3) act on the most predictive variables, promoting development, networking and integration; (4) diversifying and reaching out to all vulnerable groups; (5) continuing and sustaining action over time. The approach to populations and areas responds directly to the concept of vulnerability, which allows a variable approach to groups and people at different times of life. {Política Nacional Para La Reduccíon Del Consumo De Sustancias Psicoactivas Y Su Impacto, 2007, p.21} ~ Mitigation seeks to reduce the negative effects of risks, both before they materialize and when they have already done so and have become ""damaged."" To meet the goals, it is necessary to intervene in the conditions that influence the transition to patterns of greater commitment to consumption, to intervene in the installation of a lifestyle or the occurrence of risks and damages caused by patterns of harmful use to health and excess of self-indulgence, because the consequences are trivialized or because they catalyze sexual behaviors or high-risk use practices. {Política Nacional Para La Reduccíon Del Consumo De Sustancias Psicoactivas Y Su Impacto, 2007, p.21} ~ At the community level, it is proposed to mobilize strategies for the promotion of social capital based on committees for coexistence and reconciliation, as well as for diagnosis and participatory planning and health education at the base, with which it will be possible to actively involve all parties of the community directly or indirectly interested in finding solutions to a problem that not only belongs to those who consume and their families, as well as to mobilize secondary prevention strategies outside the scope of treatment. {Política Nacional Para La Reduccíon Del Consumo De Sustancias Psicoactivas Y Su Impacto, 2007, p.21} ~ At the household level, the strategies described at the community level will provide the family with the means to better manage the risks and damages arising from consumption, and at the individual level, where components already described at other levels also operate {Política Nacional Para La Reduccíon Del Consumo De Sustancias Psicoactivas Y Su Impacto, 2007, p.21} ~ In order to mitigate, it is necessary to prioritize the work with: consumers excluded from any institutions (no schooling, unemployed, displaced, demobilized, etc.), deprived consumers, women of reproductive age, high risk consumers for using substances that offer risk transition to injection or high impact for health and community well-being, and consumers with psychiatric comorbidity. {Política Nacional Para La Reduccíon Del Consumo De Sustancias Psicoactivas Y Su Impacto, 2007, p.22} ~ Non-formal educational actions aimed at technicians, professionals and community leaders on different aspects of social promotion: healthy environments, social participation, networking, training for work, assistance to the indigenous population and the displaced {Política Nacional Para la Reducción del Consumo de SPA y su Impacto - Sistema de Gestión Estratégica: Un camino para el montaje de las políticas y planes territoriales de reducción del consumo de sustancias psicoactivas y su impacto, 2008, p.15} ~ The Policy proposes to make prevention through actions in health promotion understood as an approach that integrates primary prevention, health education and health protection.

It also seeks the qualification and improvement in the provision of services of socio-labor to include those who are in rehabilitation process. {Política Nacional contra las Drogas, 2010-2014, p.9} ~ Attention is drawn to the findings of the study on the chemical characteristics of synthetic drugs, where it was known that only 20% of the substances marketed in Bogotá as ecstasy (MDMA), contain actual ecstasy, and mostly in very low concentrations of MDMA. Virtually all tablets contain caffeine and other stimulant substances. The remainder contain mostly mixtures of illicit drugs (cocaine, basil***?, methamphetamine) and medications of all kinds, including those of special control, many of which are very addictive. The findings of this research suggest the need to inform young people about the risks associated with the use of these drugs as part of the usual prevention strategies. {Política Nacional contra las Drogas, 2010-2014, p.41} ~ Prevention has promoted the implementation of national programs aimed at different key populations: school, workers and prisoners, among others.
