As a result, the Communal Declaration can be considered a more up-to-date elaboration of Belgian policy, rather than a replacement of the earlier document. In this sense, the action points stated in the Federal Drug Policy Note were assessed in terms of the extent to which they had been achieved, with additional steps to be taken, in the Communal Declaration. There are three overarching measures in the Communal Declaration: (i) a global and integrated approach; (ii) scientific research; and (iii) international coherence. Three pillars are used to structure action: (i) prevention, early detection and early intervention; (ii) treatment and harm reduction; (iii) repression (as a last resort). Priorities are focused on different groups within the three pillars, with prevention targeting non-(problematic) users; treatment, risk-reduction and reintegration aimed at problematic users; and repressive measures directed at producers and traffickers. Overall, the Communal Declaration interprets the drugs problem as a public health issue (EMCDDA, http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/countries/belgium#strategyhttp://www.emcdda.europa.eu/countries/belgium#strategy)","http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/countries/belgium#expenditure; Note politique du Gouvernement fédéral relative à la problématique de la drogue (2001}~ Une politique globale et intégrée en matière de drogues pour la Belgique (2010}~ Developments and Trends on Drugs - 2015, https://eurotox.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/Developments-and-trends-on-drugs-2015.pdf; Service enquêtes, mode de vie et maladies chroniques, https://drugs.wiv-isp.be/docs/Documents/Rapport_DROGUES_2014_tma.pdf;","EMCDDA's Metrics to evaluate Belgium: Prevalence of problem drug use (rate/1000), injecting drug use (rate/100) HIV infections new diagnosed (case/million), HIV prevalence %, HCV prevalence %, Drug-related deaths (rate/million), syringes distributed, clients in substitution treatment, all clients, new clients, all clients with known primary drug, new clients with known primary drug, number of reports of offenses, offenses for use/possession; It is important to note that Belgium has 2 seperate drug plans specific to the French and Flemish regions and communities of the country."

In the residential sector, therapy and counseling are essentially referring to the care offered by socio-therapeutic institutions as well as psychiatric and acute somatic care provided by psychiatric institutions and hospitals. In addition, professional integration, self-help (eg, Alcoholics Anonymous), aftercare, volunteer assistance and specific offers (eg prescription treatment for addictions in case of dependence Opiates or smoking cessation) also play an important role. {p.17}~ Psychosocial support in case of addiction is changing. In particular, the FOPH focuses its efforts on promoting the conceptual and technical development of offers in this field and, in the spirit of co-ordinating the health course, on strengthening collaboration with the medical and psychiatric field. {p.18}~ the FOPH encourages coordination and exchange between the actors of psychosocial and socio-therapeutic support in cases of addiction, and of post-cure follow-up and medical-psychiatric care. {p.18}~ The objective of the offers developed at the time - easily accessible contact and reception centers, needle exchange, opiate substitution and heroin prescribing, low-threshold facilities and supportive housing - was to enable the persons in question to free themselves from social exclusion, in order to preserve their chances of being able one day to undergo therapy. Today, risk reduction is no longer focused solely on heroin addicts in a situation of exclusion. It is also aimed at people who are integrated into society but who are exposed to significant damage or problems by consuming psychoactive substances or by borrowing money. {p.20}~ Reduction of risks and damages: Behaviors linked to addictions have less negative consequences for the individual, his entourage and society {p. 20}~ The cantons, municipalities and private institutions have therefore begun to broaden the concept of reducing risks not only to all forms of addiction but also to the potentially harmful use of psychoactive substances. {p.20}~ Mostly applied to illegal substances so far, the risk reduction approach - which consists of limiting damages linked to risky behavior and setting up offers that are not accessible only to abstinents - must be extended to all forms of addiction where this seems appropriate and necessary. {p.21}~ Prevention of communicable diseases: the FOPH encourages the exchange of knowledge and experience in the prevention, diagnosis, detection and treatment of communicable diseases (hepatitis B and C, HIV), and will prepare recommendations on these subjects with the assistance of specialists {p.21}~  by institutionalizing the exchange of knowledge and experience via specialized networks, the FOPH supports the cantons, municipalities and institutions in managing their low-threshold offers (eg Stay and consumption, needle exchange, job offers, housing solutions) and encourages the development of new instruments and methods (eg Drug Checking). {p.21}~ The FOPH is working with specialized companies to disseminate a concept to strengthen the teaching of addiction medicine in the basic training of doctors. {p.33}~ ",N,,"The objective of promoting health and prevention is also present in certain measures to promote equal opportunities, for example, combating poverty, preventing and combating violence (domestic violence), support for disadvantaged children and adolescents, as well as other integration measures. {p.14}~ Reduction of risks and damages: Behaviors linked to addictions have less negative consequences for the individual, his entourage and society {p.20}~ Risk reduction measures also affect other issues, such as violence and accidents related to the consumption of psychoactive substances and their negative impacts on the environment, in particular for family members. {p.20}~ ",N,,"The objective of promoting health and prevention is also present in certain measures to promote equal opportunities, for example, combating poverty, preventing and combating violence (domestic violence), support for disadvantaged children and adolescents, as well as other integration measures {p.14}~ To realize the objectives of therapy and counseling, it is also important to exploit the possibilities offered by the Internet, in particular in terms of interactivity, which can complement the offers of direct care and reach a wider audience {p.17}~ The promotion of interinstitutional and interprofessional collaboration as well as with stakeholders in other fields such as vocational integration, disability insurance, education, migration or integration is also an important aspect {p.17}~ optimization and promotion of the use of new technologies in prevention and counseling {p.18}~ In addition to measures to strengthen individual responsibility, the FOPH promotes a health-friendly framework, and works to raise awareness for measures not only used in health policy but also in other policy areas ( Eg, economics, education, infrastructure) that may have an impact on the population's addiction behavior. {p.23}~ the FOPH supports efforts to increase the awareness of continuing education institutions on the themes of migrants and people with a precarious socio-economic status. It is also a question of sensitizing them to the importance of integrating these themes in an appropriate treatment of the addictions {p.33}~ The Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) assists Infodrog and the specialized associations, in the development of continuing training offers for occupational groups concerned with addiction problems, such as professionals in social fields, education and integration fields, or gambling industry providers. {p.33}~ ",N,,"The National Hospice Palliative Care Strategy hopes to increase efforts to improve the coordination of care for elderly patients with addiction {p.6}~ Strengthening health promotion and prevention among the elderly {p.10}~ Sensitization of groups at risk {p.11}~ Thirdly, the elderly, whose priorities lie in the preservation of autonomy and quality of life and in the prevention of disability and dependence on care. {p.14}~ Early intervention is an approach that seeks to prevent stigma and builds on the resources of the individual {p.16}~ Strengthen health promotion and prevention among the elderly {p.16}~ The FOPH strengthens its action in the field of health promotion for the elderly. It encourages the exchange of experiences and facilitates access to information and offers of support by these individuals and their families. It ensures that these activities are aligned with those of the National Dementia Strategy, the National Hospice Palliative Care Strategy and coordinated care. It places particular emphasis on already existing risk behaviors, which can intensify as a result of difficult personal events. {p.16}~ Prison health: in conjunction with other federal offices and relevant cantonal conferences, the FOPH supports prison health actors in their efforts to enforce the principle of equivalence, to provide the same care as the rest of the population. It supports risk reduction measures (e.g., needle delivery, continuation of substitution treatment), as well as general health promotion and prevention measures. {p.21}~ Particular attention is given to risk groups, ... migrant workers, persons with a precarious socio-economic status, and people in difficult times (eg separation, loss of employment or death Of a close relative). {p.35}~ ",N,,"early interventions are used to identify risk behaviors and addictions as early as possible {p.5}~ therapy, counselling and risk reduction services are concentrated on the needs of the person concerned in order to get the best possible help and support {p.5}~ Prevention and health promotion, is a matter of strengthening health skills and individual responsibility.

[...] First, children and adolescents, whose growth and development are balanced, and, for adolescents, the acquisition of a lifestyle conducive to health. Eating habits or physical activity behaviors acquired at this stage play an important role throughout life. By encouraging healthy habits at this age, adolescents and adults will be better able to make responsible choices. As such, family, school and training play an essential role. Secondly, adults, whose main aim is to preserve health, avoid diseases, and preserve and develop their place in social and economic life. {p.14}~ The objective of promoting health and prevention, is also present in certain measures to promote equal opportunities, for example, [...] offers of support for disadvantaged children and adolescents and other integration measures. {p.14}~ Strengthen health promotion and prevention among children and adolescents {p.15}~The FOPH helps health promotion actors in schools and umbrella youth associations design and implement child and adolescent-friendly prevention projects to strengthen their health skills. In consultation with the actors, it develops the bases for the promotion of the health for children and adolescents, taking into account their main living environments (family, school and training, leisure). (P15}~ The primary objective here is to ensure, in collaboration with employers, that employees have access to health promotion opportunities. {p.15}~ The FOPH is reinforcing its commitment to early intervention, in order to quickly identify adverse developments, conditions and risky behaviors. [...]. Priorities in this area are the exchange of experiences, awareness-raising, and continuing education of professionals in the field of addictions, and professionals who are occasionally confronted with problems of addiction {p.16}~ Online consultation via SafeZone.ch: in conjunction with the cantons and the consulting institutions, the Federal Office for Public Health (FOPH) is continuing to develop the SafeZone.ch online consultancy portal and acts to anchor advice and information on the Internet and Virtual network between professionals throughout Switzerland. The FOPH encourages the development of information specific to addictions (eg via www.praticien-addiction.ch) and works on the dissemination of online self-management tools (eg self-tests ). {p.18}~ The FOPH supports the actors of primary care medicine in early intervention and the treatment of addictions by preparing the knowledge required for this purpose and making them available to them. {p.19}~ Knowledge transfer: knowledge acquired through monitoring and research is analyzed and made available to all stakeholders through congresses, publication of information on the Internet or e-mails {p.32}~ Promotion of practical tools: the FOPH supports efforts to continue to disseminate, in particular through awareness-raising among training institutions, the tools and methods available for dealing with addiction issues. For example, the FOPH supports the dissemination of the method of ""motivational interviewing"", which helps to stimulate behavior change in order to better manage his own health. {p.33}~ The prevention of health risks through information is one of the main tasks of cantonal and national health authorities. The FOPH continues to support cantons and addiction associations in their efforts to raise public awareness of addiction problems and publish information on its website. {p.34}~ Professionals and the public are actively informed about addiction issues and general health conditions.

In doing so, it ensures compliance with international standards so that this system is most compatible with international surveys such as the European Drugs Report. {p.32}~ Switzerland actively participates in international efforts to strengthen public health and privileges the international exchange of experience and knowledge. The Swiss foreign policy on health, which is the instrument guaranteeing coordination between the health policy, external policy and development cooperation policy objectives, is an important guide for its implementation. {p.37}~ Switzerland defends its interests and the objectives of the National Strategy Addictions in intergovernmental organizations or organizations (UN, WHO, UNODC, EU, Council of Europe, OECD). This includes both legally binding conventions (in the areas of illegal drugs and tobacco) and its collaboration with international strategies, action plans and the follow-up committees, and recommendations emanating from them (particularly in the fields of narcotics, Alcohol and tobacco). {p.37}~ on request or on its own initiative, the FOPH organizes and maintains bilateral and multilateral contacts on the policy of addictions with governmental representations and foreign delegations. {p.37}~ Switzerland actively participates in the work of international bodies or working groups which play an important role in the exchange of experience and knowledge. The FOPH makes the information acquired in this framework available to its national partners. {p.37}~ Switzerland implements commitments made at the international level, and coordinates its action with international strategies, action plans and recommendations. It processes the knowledge gained through its international relations so that it can be integrated into its national bodies and processes. {p.37}~ ",N,,,,,,4.5 million francs {p.45),not available,"670,789.93 USD million (2015)",,All additional documents have their own row,"A report evaluating the policy is planned to be published in 2020, and a final report in 2024 {p.47)"

[…] Likewise, the challenges of development and its gaps make it necessary to work on the recovery and strengthening of human and social capital, which is deeply violated by consumption and its unfavorable consequences {p.10}~ It is also necessary to promote the articulation of actions with the country development project, to avoid fragmentation and isolation, to provide transparency in management and to facilitate mechanisms for accountability, to promote constitutional guarantees and to protect the essence of the Social State of Law, based on the effective exercise of the rights of political, civil, economic, social and cultural citizenship, with universal character, for the whole population {p.10}~ From this perspective, public policy in the area of psychoactive substance use, in addition to improving the physical and mental health conditions of those already involved, should aim to alleviate the associated suffering and to develop conditions that allow control over the factors that put at risk the options of life, the development of capacities, the health and the well-being. This means transcending the service delivery approach and engaging in the overall debate on the country's development agenda. An agenda that prioritizes the search for conditions for peace, security and overcoming poverty and inequality. {p.11}~ Social protection, thus understood, seeks to provide means to help the population more effectively manage the risks, and prevent the loss of well-being and depletion in human capital (asset sales, irreversible damages) for the most vulnerable groups, as well as the eventual loss of income due to a multiplicity of risks. To this end, prevention, mitigation and improvement strategies are put in place, and informal, market and public supply systems are energized with the participation of multiplicity of actors, including individuals, households, institutions, levels of government and the market. {p.15}~ Therefore, fostering opportunities for belonging to groups in conditions of vulnerability (prevention), as well as for groups already involved and recovered (mitigation, overcoming) will contribute to the construction and strengthening of social capital and contribute to overcome inequalities {p.16}~ At the same time, it is hoped to optimize the distribution of scarce and finite resources (technical and financial), thus maximizing welfare, and guaranteeing the right of to access all opportunities to prevent, mitigate and overcome the conditions and factors that make the risks and vulnerability to the consumption of SPA more dynamic. {p.18}~ Finally, social inclusion will be used as a tool to prevent, mitigate and, above all, overcome or deal with the ""after effects"" of having an active commitment to alcohol or other substances. {p.19}~ At the macrosocial level, it is proposed to carry out actions of social development, normative, cultural and regulatory deconstruction, control and social responsibility. It is recognized that this is one of the levels in which the greatest challenges are faced, since in many cases structural aspects are difficult to control. However, it is necessary to recognize that one of the factors with greater protective power is the opportunity to develop in a ""pro-social"" environment, sufficiently rewarding, to provide means and resources for the development of assets, to offer a cultural and formal protection that discourages the demand for SPA and protects against harmful effects.  {p.20}~ In the fields of rehabilitation and social inclusion, it is proposed to respond to the difficulties that many entities face for reasons of infrastructure and qualification of human resources, as well as reduce barriers commonly encountered by rehabilitated consumers to reintegrate into social life and productivity. {p.22}~ In addition to intersectoral and interinstitutional coordination and cooperation, as well as families and communities educated and sensitized to the importance of rehabilitation and social inclusion {p.22}~ All this also puts us in a scenario in which political action is based on respect for human and social rights, promoting every action that involves improving social cohesion and the inclusion of groups in vulnerable situations, ensuring access to media and real opportunities for social integration in both prevention and impact responses. {p.25}~ Within an integrated framework of development as a country agenda, social work requires the effective development of networks and synergies between policies and institutions in terms of social welfare, health promotion and strengthening of the aspects that contribute to human and social capital. {p.25}~ Therefore, the exercise of building a policy for the country in the field of social protection implies an inescapable commitment to guarantee rights, the development of capacities and opportunities, the fight against inequity and lack of social integration. This would make a difference in aspects that strongly influence the choice of substance use as a way of life for many children and young people of our country. Any effort in this regard contributes to the promotion and protection of human capital or, in other words and as stated in Law 789 of 2002, to improve the quality of life and reduce the vulnerability of citizens {Política Nacional Para La Reduccíon Del Consumo De Sustancias Psicoactivas Y Su Impacto, 2007, p.10} ~

",N,,"On the other hand, and at the same time, with other countries, Colombia has experienced changes in the internal dynamics of production, traffic and consumption, which has forced to recognize that it is crucial to promote demand control efforts as much as those that control supply {p.8}~ If we want to move towards a more inclusive society, it is urgent to invest in children and young people, so that they have effective access to sources of well-being, security and equality of accumulation of human capital, precisely because exclusion reduces the choice of life and consumption appears as an option for an increasingly important number of young people in our country. {p.11}~ The priority of the Policy will focus on any use of legal and illegal SPAs in minors, as well as pregnant or lactating women, in accordance with the principles of Social Protection and legislation. {p.17}~ The ultimate goal of the policy is to reduce the incidence and prevalence of psychoactive substance use in Colombia and to mitigate the negative impact of consumption on the individual, family, community and society. Its overall objective or purpose is to offer an integrated, participatory, co-responsible, and effective response to the consumption of psychoactive substances and their impact, based on a common ethical, philosophical, conceptual, operational and management framework. {p.18}~ To intervene on a greater number of conditions, and macrosocial, microsocial and personal factors that increase the vulnerability to the consumption of SPA {p.18}~ The Policy proposes a general framework that aims to guide actions in prevention, mitigation,  and overcoming the risks and damages associated with the consumption of alcohol and other substances, with particular emphasis on the aspects defined as a priority object of the Policy: use of SPA In children, abuse of drugs and volatile substances, problem use and dependence on licit and illicit substances {p.18}~ In order to reduce the incidence of SPA consumption in the country, it is necessary to move towards the achievement of the first strategic objective, for which the operational axis of prevention is proposed, and whose goal is to prevent/avoid the onset and abuse of psychoactive substances at any moment of the life cycle. {p.18}~ Reduce the prevalence of consumption and mitigate the negative impact, requires approaching the second strategic objective and, consequently, the development of the operational axes of mitigation and overcoming, whose goals are: to prevent/avoid the progression of those who have already started to consume and transit drugs, to problematic patterns of or dependence (prevalence}~ To prevent those who have already started in consumption, and are at constant risk, of affecting their physical, mental, emotional, family and social health and that, because of their consumption, endanger others (impact}~ And to avoid that those who have surpassed their condition of active consumption by will, and have maintained a lifestyle free of ""drugs"", return to him (prevalence). {p.18}~ These components of health promotion and its sub-components (prevention, health education and health protection) will prevent and mitigate the risks associated with the consumption of alcohol and other substances, provide assistance and care to mitigate and reduce the risks of active and continued consumption and damages already provoked {p.19}~ In the context of social protection, prevention is a strategy to manage social risk more effectively. It is put in place before the risk is manifested and seeks to reduce the likelihood that an adverse shock will affect the health, quality of life and well-being of individuals, households and communities. {p.19}~ Since the goal of the prevention axis is to prevent/avoid the onset and abuse of psychoactive substances at any point in the life cycle, it is necessary to operate on contextual, situational, family and individual conditions or variables that increase risk and vulnerability to the onset and maintenance of licit and illicit substances use. In particular, those that are more predictive of the risk and those that can be intervened with the resources that have or can be enhanced. In the scenario of prevention as risk management, ""legal"" and illicit ""drugs"" exist, so it is necessary to offer the means to ""live"" with them by choosing not to experiment with licit substances at an early stage and, if they come into contact with them, that they do not try the illicit ones (prevention). If they are still in contact with them, that they do not move to patterns that are even more harmful to health and well-being (mitigation and improvement). {p.19}~ The micro-social level aims to work on risk and protection factors from socialization domains fundamental to the individual: the family, the school, the social reference group (peers) and the community in general. Strategies refer to the development and strengthening of the family, fundamental not only because it is a socializing medium par excellence, but also because exogenous crises are recreated inside, reflecting the risk and vulnerability of the environment and weakening its socializing capacities. {p.20}~ Other strategies refer to the construction of support networks in all the vital areas of development of subjects. The Policy recognizes that these are ideal scenarios for the development of prevention, but it also urges a revision of the perspective that limits, for example, the school to being an ""ideal"" ground for prevention, in order to return to its essential role as a socializing sphere and as a constitutive part of the social support network of children, adolescents, families and communities. {p.20}~ However, it is necessary to overcome the ""problematic"" vision of the young person (as proposed by the National Youth Policy), which distances itself from the subject's understanding and knowledge, indispensable for building a shared vision of the world and transforming reality. {p.20}~ The proposed strategies refer to the promotion of personal development and resilience, as well as to the creation of information and service networks, prioritizing social protection to children, adolescents and young people in vulnerable conditions, strengthening formal and informal mechanisms of protection, as well as social networks. This not only seeks to create support environments, but also to provide concrete means for better risk management, free access from barriers for groups with the greatest need. {p.20}~ In order for the strategies and actions of the prevention operative axis to consolidate the fulfillment of the goal, one must: 1) know the reality to be transformed, 2) involve stakeholders in all phases of the process, 3) act on the most predictive variables, promoting development, networking and integration; (4) diversifying and reaching out to all vulnerable groups; (5) continuing and sustaining action over time. The approach to populations and areas responds directly to the concept of vulnerability, which allows a variable approach to groups and people at different times of life. {p.21}~ Mitigation seeks to reduce the negative effects of risks, both before they materialize and when they have already done so and have become ""damaged."" To meet the goals, it is necessary to intervene in the conditions that influence the transition to patterns of greater commitment to consumption, to intervene in the installation of a lifestyle or the occurrence of risks and damages caused by patterns of harmful use to health and excess of self-indulgence, because the consequences are trivialized or because they catalyze sexual behaviors or high-risk use practices. {p.21}~ In other words, intermediate and pre-treatment actions need to be implemented in formal and informal settings (educational, labor, community and health). It is complementary to treatment services, and allows to reduce the risks associated with various patterns of consumption, as well as dependence, in cases where there is still no access to formal treatment for various reasons {p.21}~ At the social level, the policy strategy and health regulatory environments seek to mobilize the necessary, from policies, norms and systems, to remove potential obstacles in effective protection of health and well-being, as well as to facilitate cultural , contextual, normative, institutional or political change that is required. {p.21}~ The strategy of reorienting care and assistance proposes to flexibilize alternatives for care, assistance and welcome ""excluded"" groups from their incorporation into the information, services, assistance and social support networks. To this end, it will be sought to train the existing service networks, so that from the primary and basic care, it is possible to make early identification of problems associated with consumption, make brief interventions and referrals to the formal and informal service networks for the subject {p.21}~ In the same vein, the network strategy at the level of community intervention {see Prevention axis) will be aimed at guiding and assisting those affected to some degree, by the consumption of SPA, as complementary measures to the formal protection mechanisms, which will help reduce the impact of SPA consumption on public health, productivity and human capital. {p.21}~ At the community level, it is proposed to mobilize strategies for the promotion of social capital based on committees for coexistence and reconciliation, as well as for diagnosis and participatory planning and health education at the base, with which it will be possible to actively involve all parties of the community directly or indirectly interested in finding solutions to a problem that not only belongs to those who consume and their families, as well as to mobilize secondary prevention strategies outside the scope of treatment. {p.21}~ At the household level, the strategies described at the community level will provide the family with the means to better manage the risks and damages arising from consumption, and at the individual level, where components already described at other levels also operate {p.21}~ In order to mitigate, it is necessary to prioritize the work with: consumers excluded from any institutions (no schooling, unemployed, displaced, demobilized, etc.), deprived consumers, women of reproductive age, high risk consumers for using substances that offer risk transition to injection or high impact for health and community well-being, and consumers with psychiatric comorbidity. {p.22}~ In the field of treatment, it is proposed to adjust supply to demand and diversify treatment supply by geographical areas, socio-economic strata, genders, patterns of use and co-morbid conditions. It seeks to achieve an ""inclusive"" supply structure for the diversity of alcohol consumers and other substances that do not find answers to their needs in the style of available treatments.  {p.22}~ The strategies of overcoming refer to the treatment, rehabilitation and social inclusion of those who have developed a disorder of dependence to one or several substances, or present a problematic pattern of consumption in the absence of dependency. {p.22}~ The proposed strategies are based on the fulfillment of the objectives of the provision of service policy under the General System of Social Security in Health: 1) improve access to services, 2) improve the quality of care, and 3) Generate efficiency in the provision of services and achieve the financial sustainability of public IPS. {p.22}~ It is urgent to make efforts to expand the benefits plan so that substance-use disorders of high priority substances can be addressed within the system, for which it is proposed to focus and prioritize care in cases of high impact due to the severity of physical dependence, and strong linkage with anomic behaviors or high risk for physical health {p.22}~   It is necessary to mobilize networks and cooperation, in order to obtain means that allow the rehabilitation and social inclusion of the consumer, in which entities belonging to the Social Protection System can contribute to the achievement of the objectives of vocational rehabilitation (SENA) and Physical Family Allowance. {p.22}~ Create registration, monitoring and evaluation models for prevention, mitigation and improvement work. {p.23}~ Research planning should be based on local patterns to prioritize the study of vulnerable groups, the mapping of local and community resources, and the construction of contextualized responses. {p.23}~ One line is to apply high-risk approaches, as well as selective and targeted prevention (focused on groups most in need of vulnerability - not necessarily poverty). Another line proposes to use alternative methodologies, which allows greater control over the variables that need to be intervened to transform reality (management and social action). A final line consists of the creation of mechanisms that allow integrating efforts to act on multiple risk factors, and those  of a more predictable nature. {p.24}~ Broadly speaking, the policy seeks to control the risks associated with the consumption of SPA, to promote the creation of protective and pro-drug-free environments, to integrate actions to optimize the use of resources, to involve the base, so that in addition to living the problem is an integral part of the solution, to base and govern action in ethics and good practice. {p.25}~ The promotion of favorable and protective environment, demands social and cultural transformations, with the participation of all the actors and mediators who have something to contribute to the understanding of reality as well as its transformation, so that a participatory and co-management is possible, as well as an integrative approach. {p.25}~

The situation is even more critical if one analyzes the last decade in which, despite a significant reduction in the extent of coca cultivation, the area of influence is maintained with a greater dispersion of the distribution in the lots, causing the involvement of a greater number of peasants in the business with a subsequent decrease of income per family. {p.29}~ Consolidation of illicit free crops regions: Seeks the final eradication, prevention of replanting illicit substance, and avoiding the displacement of the population involved in illicit crops to other regions of the country, by offering different legal alternatives.

It establishes guidelines or parameters for the eradication of illicit crops, the control of substances used in the processing of narcotics and creates a new institutional infrastructure, more robust than the incipient and rudimentary established in the 1970s. {p.12}~ Article 34, for example, stipulates that property acquired through illicit enrichment to the detriment of the public treasury or with serious deterioration of social morality is stipulated, and Article 35 authorizes the extradition of native Colombians for crimes committed abroad {p.12}~ The table shows that efforts in reducing illicit crops have been oriented at spraying and manual eradication, accompanied by alternative development programs aimed at promoting culture legality, and generating licit alternatives for agricultural production growers {p.22}~ This set of implemented efforts to counter the problem, parallel complementary work to combat armed illegal groups, who profit from the drug trade. {p.22}~ The results of the State in the fight against Criminal Bands of drug traffickers - BACRIM, show the permanent commitment to face all the criminal manifestations and, specifically, to these criminal organizations that have acquired a capacity of organization and affectation that surpasses the traditional models, given its high adaptability and transformation to absorb all kinds of delinquent manifestations, especially those associated with drug trafficking, the very essence of BACRIM. {p.24}~ The security forces have been confronting these criminal organizations, through actions such as: captures, deaths in operational procedures, seizures of arms and drugs, as well as blocking routes for the transportation of drugs and chemical inputs. {p.24}~ Both the National Police as the Armed Forces have the constitutional obligation to combat these organizations decisively, in order to protect the population and ensure the observance of the Constitution and the law {p.25}~ The crucial factors contributing to their decline are forced manual eradication, aerial spraying, seizures of drugs and chemicals used in processing, the public order situation, diseases and pests that attack plantations and alternative development programs. {p.26}~ In compliance with the policy of the eradication of illicit crops, the Colombian state has combined the strategy of aerial spraying, manual eradication, and alternative development {p.27}~ Consolidation of regions that are free of illicit crops: It seeks the final eradication, prevention of replanting and new plantings, and avoiding the splitting of the population involved in illicit crops to other regions of the country, by offering different legal alternatives. Among these regions are the Pilot Knot Plan of Paramillo: South of Córdoba, Bajo Cauca Antioqueño and Southeastern Antioqueño, Plan of Integral Consolidation of the Macarena-Meta. {p.30}~ Containment zones consisting of the joint implementation of preventive and coercive means to prevent the displacement of existing crops to other areas of the national territory, i.e., to respond to the balloon effect.

In fact, the controls exercised, the regulations issued and, in general, the interdiction actions carried out, have contributed to this. In this sense, the guidelines of this nature have allowed military, police and judicial authorities to prevent a proportion of these goods from being diverted to the production of narcotic drugs. {p.32}~ In compliance with these guidelines, the Colombian law enforcement authorities conduct daily seizures and immobilization operations of chemical substances used for the extraction and processing of naturally occurring alkaloids. {p.32}~ 
The fact that the use of chemical substances in drug extraction processes is far superior to seizures suggests the need to strengthen operational, administrative and judicial controls on the entry and marketing of chemical substances. As well as investigating and prosecuting corruption cases that limit effective and efficient control of chemicals. {p.33}~ Taking into account that in Colombia for more than 3 decades, drug traffickers have acquired considerable experience in carrying out their drug trafficking activities, national authorities must design strategies that prevent the transition of the production and trafficking of drugs of natural origin to those of synthetic origin. {p.33}~ Given the novelty and complexity for the comprehensive approach to this emerging phenomenon, it is essential to design and implement strategies aimed at shielding the Colombian territory against the establishment of synthetic laboratories and the emergence of groups specialized in traffic. {p.34}~ To carry out this process efficiently, we need to update criminal and administrative regulations related to precursor chemicals and the implementation of training processes aimed at administrators of justice on specific issues such as drugs. Further, it is essential to strengthen forensic capacity to work in coordination with drug observatories to establish early warning systems based on technical evidence, which will serve as an essential tool for more efficient intervention in both demand and supply. {p.34}~ It is necessary to train the interdiction control authorities for the possible technical intervention to production infrastructures, taking into account that the synthesis laboratories demand specialized knowledge for their dismantling, so as to avoid accidents and negative consequences to the environment.  {p.34}~ State policy has been aimed at blocking the transit drug routes, ensuring coordination of these actions meeting the objectives in strengthening strategic security and surveillance of borders (sea, river and land) and air traffic control by means of an adequate definition of roles and responsibilities {p.36}~ technical intelligence should be strengthened as there are lots of national territory, including land and water areas that do not have a Ideal surveillance {p.38}~ In Colombia, the profit obtained from drug trafficking has been decisively attacked through: (i) criminal prosecution for money laundering, (ii) expansion of coverage of the sectors required to report suspicious transactions to the Financial Information and Analysis Unit (Iii) adaptation of the Financial Superintendence to reinforce its actions in the prevention and control of money laundering, (iv) regulation of the professional activity of buying and selling foreign currency and traveler's checks through the Comprehensive System of Prevention and Control of Money Laundering (SIPLA), v) creation of a special group of Judicial Police and investigators made up of the Technical Investigation Corps (CTI), Administrative Department of Security (DAS) and the National Judicial Intelligence Directorate, (vi) actions for the extinction of a domain for the purpose of depriving criminal organizations of the enjoyment of unlawful profits And (vii) strengthening of the extradition process, among others. {p.46}~ Reduce in a systematic and integral way the persistence of the conditions that favor the drug problem in Colombia and mitigate in a sustainable way the adverse consequences. {p.51}~ Promote the active participation of civil society, the international community and of the State to make Colombia a model country in the intervention of the World Drug Problem, by making the production, trafficking and laundering of its benefits unviable, and to reduce the conditions that make it vulnerable to the consumption of psychoactive substances and to improve the responses to its consequences. {p.51}~ Strategies aimed at reducing the supply and demand for drugs must be articulated and mutually reinforcing, keeping a balance between the institutional investment and financial resources allocated to policy control and reduction of drug abuse.

So, for purposes of this document, the process of illicit drug production ranges from the arrival of chemicals or even cultivation to obtain cocaine hydrochloride. {p.63}~ Goals: 1) Establish the

However, criminal proceedings shall not be instituted if the perpetrator of the offense consents, after a medical examination carried out at the request of the public prosecutor, to submit to a detoxification treatment for the necessary amount of time it will take for his cure, to which the treatment will take place either in a therapeutic establishment under the conditions laid down in Article 80 of the Criminal Code or in a private clinic approved by the Ministry of Public Health. In these latter cases, the individual undergoing treatment should be examined every fortnight by an expert doctor appointed by the King's prosecutor - this physician alone will be qualified to decide on the cure. An order provided by the Minister of Justice, made after consultation with the Minister of Public Health, will determine the conditions that would allow, in exceptional cases, especially for minors, to be treated in a family environment. Criminal proceedings shall be instituted by the acts provided for in the first paragraph, without prejudice to the prosecution of the new offense, if within three years after the cure, the individual is again the perpetrator of an offense for use or trafficking of narcotic drugs. If information has been opened, the investigating magistrate may, after consulting the King's prosecutor, order that the person concerned be subjected to treatment under the conditions laid down in subparagraphs (2) and (3) above. The enforcement of the prescription prescribing this cure will continue, if necessary after the information is closed.

The examining magistrate who is seised of a judicial investigation relating to facts of the same nature may also carry out searches and seizures under the same conditions after notifying the public prosecutor of the King. It may issue letters rogatory for the same purposes in accordance with the provisions of Articles 106 and following of the Criminal Code Procedure {p.929}~ Art 11 - In all the cases provided for in the preceding articles, the courts shall confiscate the substances or plants seized, pursuant to Article 89 of the Criminal Code, as well as all sums of money procured by the offense. They shall also order the seizure of materials and facilities for the processing or manufacture of substances or plants and means of transport. In the cases provided for in Article 3.1, the seizure ordered may order the confiscation of all movable and immovable property, the premises of which are garnished or decorated, and equipment intended or used for the use of narcotic drugs. The provisions of Article 87 of the Criminal Code are applicable to the persons exercising the professions in respect of which the offenses were committed. The security measure provided for in Article 90 of the Criminal Code authorizing the closure of establishments where offenses have been committed may be ordered either provisionally by the investigating magistrate or by the jurisdiction of the court under the conditions laid down in that Article. {p.929}~ Art. 13 - The rules of recidivism provided for in the penal code are applicable to the offenses punishable by this Dahir bearing the law. {p.929}~ Article 14 - The provisions of the first paragraph of Article 5 of the Dahir of 20 Chaabane 1373 (24 April 1954) prohibiting hemp in Kif are repealed and replaced by the following provisions: Article 5 (first paragraph - Infringements to the present dahir shall be punished with the penalties provided for in Articles 1 to 8 inclusively, 11 to 13 inclusive of the dahir bearing the law n ° 1-73-282 of the rebia II 1394 21 May 1974) on repression of drug addiction and prevention of drug addicts.{p.929}~ Art 15 - The provisions of subparagraphs 2 and 3 of Article 5 of the Dahir of 20 Chaabane 1373 (24 April 1954), as amended and supplemented, are hereby repealed.

This type of treatment is part of the National Risk Reduction Programme in Morocco (“Programme National de Réduction des Risques au Maroc”).

",N,,"Morocco has developed its anti-drug policy based on a strategy focused on reducing offer, curbing both trafficking and demand, and the implementation of measures designed to encourage alternative development {p.10}~ One of the most important drug-related laws in Morocco is the dahir establishing law No. 1-73-282 of 21 May 1974, punishing drug addiction. It punishes both possession and use of substances or plants categorized as a narcotic and the act of facilitating by any means the use of these substances or plants. {p.15}~ Article 8 of this law takes into account addicts’ interests as it does acknowledge the importance of treatment and care of narcotics addicts. Indeed, this Article provides that “criminal prosecution will not be brought if the author of the crime, following a medical exam performed at the request of the Royal Prosecutor, consents to go into treatment for drug addiction for as long as is needed […] and that “the investigating judge can, on the advice of the Royal Prosecutor, compel treatment"" [...] Article 8 also provides for the exceptional possibility, where the defendant is a minor, to “provide treatment in a family setting, and in conformity with the conditions determined by order of the Minister of Justice made after consulting with the Ministry of Health”. However, in practice, the measures provided for in Article 8 are only very rarely implemented {p.15}~ The creation of “clubs de la citoyenneté” constitutes the premises for national action in terms of prevention. Of these clubs, the health club, communication club, theatre club and other clubs for leisure activities have been introduced in schools to be more supportive of students and explain to them the serious dangers of drug abuse. {p.17}~ The Ministry of Health has developed a “social communication strategy for the prevention of drug abuse” covering the period 2008-2012. The objectives of this programme were: 1) Preventing drug addiction amongst young people and vulnerable populations, combined with the promotion of mental wellbeing. 2) Improving the quality of the care available to drug addicts. […] 4) Treating drug addiction and rehabilitating drug users. {p.18}~ The Ministry intends to prevent addictive behaviours and promote a healthy lifestyle, notably by implementing a social communication strategy {p.18}~ A number of Moroccan organisations are also active in the field of drug prevention. This is the case for example of the “Moroccan Society against tobacco and drugs” (“Association marocaine de lutte contre le tabac et les drogues “) which led a number of prevention campaigns throughout the year and the country to raise Moroccan’s awareness of the risks associated with the use of illegal substances. {p.18}~ The Moroccan Ministry of Health’s strategy to tackle addiction is focused on improving the quality of medical care available to addicts, establishing specialised medical consultation units in the different regions, strengthening the care network, creating mobile specialised unites operating from teaching hospitals, and promoting youth healthcare centres offering psychological counselling in Rabat, Beni Mellal, Marrakesh, and Casablanca. {p.22}~ The national 2015-2016 action plan to combat drug addiction provides for the creation of hospital units specialised in addiction issues in Berrechid, Kenitra, El Kelâa Sraghna, and Agadir {p.22}~

",,"Morocco has developed its anti-drug policy based on a strategy focused on reducing offer, curbing both trafficking and demand, and the implementation of measures designed to encourage alternative development {p.10}~ Concretely, this strategy simultaneously stresses police action, the destruction of cannabis crops, including through programmes for the development of alternative crops, and the reduction of demand, which requires the development of economic alternatives, so as to slow the progression of cannabis production in Morocco’s Northern regions {p.10}~ The Moroccan government has thus reinforced police forces in the Rif Mountains and along the Northern sea borders to prevent drug trafficking operations and staff all drug enforcement checkpoints. Government forces now use helicopters, planes, fast ships, mobile backscatter x-ray machines, ultrasound technology, and satellites to combat drug trafficking. {p.11}~ Moreover, Moroccan law provides for a maximum prison sentence of 30 years for drug-related offences, as well as fines for lesser drug-related offences ranging from 15 000 to 60 000 euros. Prison sentences ranging from ten to fifteen years remain the most common sentence for drug traffickers sentenced in Morocco. {p.12}~ Morocco’s policy dictates that it firmly condemn the production and distribution of drugs and money laundering resulting from illegal drug transactions. {p.13}~ Since 2003, Morocco has adopted a series of measures to strengthen the enforcement of its law on money laundering, including the implementation in May 2007 of a further law on money laundering and the creation in Rabat of a Financial Intelligence Unit. This law provides for the obligation to account for suspicious financial transactions by any legally responsible agent, whether public or private, who in the exercise of his functions, executes or facilitates the movement of funds potentially linked to drug trafficking, human trafficking, arms trafficking, corruption, terrorism, tax evasion, or counterfeiting {p.13}~ Law No. 43-05, adopted and implemented in 2007, strengthened the national regulatory framework punishing activities linked to drug trafficking. The Unit can exchange financial intelligence on money laundering and financing terrorism with foreign agencies with similar competences. {p.14}~ The dahir of 3 October 1977 (amended by No. 1993/52) created the National Commission on Narcotics (Commission Nationale des Stupéfiants). This Commission is made up of the various government departments in charge of the medical and social fields or of enforcement.

The idea would be to ensure that the quantity of methadone corresponding to the required daily doses is available during the period of hospitalisation; the methadone would be kept by the hospital care team and distributed to patients on a daily basis. {p.69}~  Moroccan harm reduction policy has as its main aim to “secure access for drug users to prevention, HIV screening and good-quality treatment and care services”. This aim was reflected in the field in (1) the stepping up of prevention activities meeting the needs of IDUs exposed to the risk of HIV and HCV infection; (2) ensuring access for identified IDUs to appropriate screening, treatment and care; (3) stimulating community responses to drug users in the fight against HIV/AIDS; and (4) establishing national steering of the harm reduction system in order to guarantee the complementarity and coherence of the whole. {p.77}~
