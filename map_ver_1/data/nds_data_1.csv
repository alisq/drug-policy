The General Unit for Drugs Policy and its working cells 'Drugs Health Policy Cell', 'Control' and 'International Cooperation Unit' and the Drugs Inter-Ministerial Conference are the coordination and negotiation forums for the operationalization of the global policy and and the Declaration; Scientific Institute of Public Health","Provide assistance, risk reduction and reinsertion for problematic consumers (p.7); Reduce the physical and psychosocial problems that can result from drug abuse (p.7); A uniform recording of data on clinical treatment is essential, as is the inventory of existing epidemiological research and the collection of its results. The ""blind spots"" need to be identified, and new more targeted studies have to be initiated (p.38); It is necessary to provide care pathways for specific target groups (such as patients with dual diagnosis) (p.48); The exchange of syringes must go hand in hand with the communication of information on the correct use of the equipment, the existence and indications of the serological tests and the offer of psychological, social, medical and legal assistance (P.56); Care for addicts, and in particular institutional care, is very costly. It is important that drug dependent users seeking assistance receive that assistance and support as effectively as possible. The Federal Government will commission the Federal Scientific, Technical and Cultural Affairs to carry out one or more evaluation studies on the effectiveness (results) of assistance to drug dependent users. Such an assessment can only be carried out via a longitudinal study. All relevant equipment and actors must be assessed (hospitals, categorical structures, mental health centers, doctors, ...). (P. 41); Scientific experiments on the controlled distribution of heroin have been carried out abroad (notably in the Netherlands and Switzerland). The federal government will evaluate the results of these experiments. (p.56); The objectives in assisting dual diagnosis groups (comorbid diagnosis) are to improve the general level of functioning, reduce drug use and related problems, stabilize psychiatric disorders, reduce harm, and resocialization (housing, work and daily occupation). (P. 52); It is necessary to provide care pathways for specific target groups (such as patients with dual diagnosis) (p.48);  the Ministry of Social Affairs is seeking a solution to the problem of drug users who are not covered by health insurance, more specifically for those who are subject by the law to conditional freedom, or semi-freedom, and who are seeking treatment. (p.50); The federal government will examine the possibility of investing drug-confiscated money in drug assistance and prevention (including therapeutic counseling). It is mainly the financing of the care of drug addicts not covered by health insurance that could be improved (p.68); ","Decrease the number of drug-dependent citizens (p.7);  The Belgian Observatory for Drugs and Drug Addiction will be responsible for the implementation of European standardized indicators (from the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction). For 2000, these include: drug use in the general population, prevalence of problem drug use, need for care, mortality and infectious morbidity. (p.38); The objectives in assisting dual diagnosis groups (comorbid diagnosis) are to improve the general level of functioning, reduce drug use and related problems, stabilize psychiatric disorders, reduce harm, and resocialization (housing, work and daily occupation). (P. 52); Subsitution treatments: decreased use of other opiates, an increase in social productivity, a decrease in risk behavior, improved physical and mental health and decreased mortality (p.55)","","Reduce the negative consequences that result from the drug phenomenon in our society (including social nuisance) (p.7); It is preferable to approach problematic consumption (which does not go hand in hand with common law offenses) through an offer of assistance focusing on reintegration, instead of punishing the person concerned and thus imposing additional suffering on him. The federal government therefore advocates an effective prevention policy. (p.8); There is a need for good connections between the functions of change-oriented care (abstinence), risk reduction and social care for addicts (providing basic survival and reducing social nuisance) (p.48);  the repression of mere consumption and, to a certain extent, consumption linked to criminal acts or in connection with social nuisances, must constitute the final stage of the action of the public prosecutor's office and justify itself only as a remedy for a recurring individual problem (p.57); An awareness-raising or information campaign (organized by the Belgian Institute for Road Safety) informs the road user preventively about the existence of the law (and the reasons for its existence) and the rights and duties relating to it; the aim of the Act is to increase traffic safety and not to address drug use or to target or even discriminate certain (age) groups (p.44); The federal government therefore advocates an effective prevention policy (p.8); Magistrates should be encouraged (possibly through legislative changes) to use the probation law as often as possible. Conditional sentences or fines are still too often pronounced. The proposed law on alternative sentences will allow penal judges to replace prison sentences with better penalties (p.66); Protect society and its members confronted with the phenomena of drugs. (p.9) It also concerns drug addicts to whom the necessary assistance must be given in order to enable them to live a life in accordance with human dignity in spite of drugs (by encouraging risk reduction policy). (p.9); Criminal policy must be adapted to drug users. It should be avoided that users who have not committed offenses end up in prison. (p.9); to combat the driving of vehicles under the influence of the products concerned (p.11); Drug users who have not committed offenses should not be subject to entering prison. Prisons are not the place to treat drug addicts. The first objective of a prison is to ensure the security of society. Instead, drug addicts (problematic) who are dealing with the police or the judicial system, should be reoriented, first and foremost, towards assistance. (p.14); Psychoactive drugs, smart drugs and the influence of legal and illegal drugs on driving behavior are important aspects of the prevention policy (p.11); ","N","","Initiatives aimed at directing (ex) addicts to the labor market should be better aligned (p.54);The objectives in assisting dual diagnosis groups (comorbid diagnosis) are to improve the general level of functioning, reduce drug use and related problems, stabilize psychiatric disorders, reduce harm, and resocialization (housing, work and daily occupation). (P. 52); In order to oppose the economic dependence of drug production, a structural economic development policy must be put in place in order to actively promote substitution crops (p.13); ","The objectives in assisting dual diagnosis groups (comorbid diagnosis) are to improve the general level of functioning, reduce drug use and related problems, stabilize psychiatric disorders, reduce harm,  and resocialization (housing, work and daily occupation) (p.52);","","Ensure that drug addicted prisoners have access to substitution treatment. (p.9); Attention needs to be paid, both to epidemiology and to evaluation, to specific gender variables and differences (p.39); Finally, when a drug user is incarcerated, care must be taken (within the framework of a coherent penitentiary policy) to guarantee him a place of life which will enable him to escape from his possible dependence. This requires the eradication of drugs in the prison environment, but the individual dependent on drugs must also be able to access the appropriate support and therapy services, as well as the continuity of the care after his release. (p.57); Non-native drug users are underrepresented in certain forms of assistance. They would also be less likely to take advantage of alternative penal measures and thus find themselves in prison more often. […] It is desirable to increase the number of non-native caregivers. We must try to find the forms of assistance that offer the most guarantees of social reintegration. Equipment must provide additional efforts to reach non-native drug users (P. 49); In order to avoid stigmatization caused by a criminal record, the first conditional sentence will no longer be mentioned on the extract from the criminal record (necessary when applying for a job) insofar as it relates to drug-related facts (other than traffic). The conditional sentence (as well as the suspension) will, however, always be entered in the criminal record so that the police and the justice are not deprived of this information. (P.66); The drug user must be able to rely on the same quality of care as he would be entitled to if he were not detained (P.68); The obligation to respond to the medical and psychosocial problems of prisoners must be stressed in order to manage crisis situations and to guide prisoners towards an adequate solution (p.69); In each health care facility, a doctor working for psychosocial services will be the inmate's reference worker. He shall be responsible for the inmates treatment and shall ensure the continuity of treatment in the event that the prisoner is transferred to another establishment. He will also, as soon as possible, personally contact the assistance services in the event of release of the detainee. The referring physician will ensure the continuation substitution treatment if the prisoner is transferred (p.69); Substitution treatment will be mainly reserved for pregnant women, prisoners who carry out short sentences, to prisoners who are HIV positive or who carry the hepatitis virus (P.69)
","N","","Decrease the number of citizens dependent on drugs (p.7); Prevention for non-consumers and non-problematic consumers (p.7); The most important objective is the deterrence and reduction of illegal drug use, which also means reducing the number of new consumers through prevention (p.9); The Federal Government asks the communities to continue their prevention efforts and recognizes their autonomous competence in this field (p.42); The Minister of Public Health will review the registration of benzodiazepines and Amphetamines. [...] warnings will be added on the packaging and in the leaflets for benzodiazepines (p.42); A prevention campaign will also be launched to draw the attention of the public to the dangers of benzodiazepines (including the circulation) (p.43); The prescribing behaviors of doctors related to potentially addictive substances will be accompanied and monitored by the Medical Assessment Groups (GLEM) and thr Provincial Medical Commissions, on a preventive and repressive basis (p.43); Federal Government will take Action to Reduce the Influence of the Pharmaceutical Industry on the prescribing behavior of doctors and will take concrete initiatives to limit the publicity for medicinal products to scientific and objective information (p.43); The federal government will ask the Communities to structurally integrate prevention in the training of teachers, and to free up the necessary space in the curricula (For example, through the ""Key to Life"" curriculum) (p.46); Prevention initiatives should also be supported and evaluated in a scientific manner in accordance with the guidelines and evaluation criteria of the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction in Lisbon (p.47); Prevention must, moreover, concern all drugs, legal and illegal (p.47); Preventing early addiction [...] , delay or control consumption and reduce substance abuse (p.11); In addition to epidemiological studies, the sector also calls for a uniform, permanent and scientific evaluation of treatment and prevention (p.41); Secondary and tertiary prevention will also receive the necessary attention; these two steps are oriented towards the rapid detection of problems in consumers, and towards the limitation of damage to regular consumers. (p.47); ","","","The development of an ""early warning system"" for new synthetic drugs has been under way since December 1997. The national focal point, sub-focal points and various laboratories are collaborating to identify new drugs and to establish the profile of their consumption (p.40); The fight against drug trafficking is the first priority of any criminal policy aimed at restricting drug use and resulting crime (p.57); Federal programs on organized crime and white-collar crime are of particular importance in the fight against organized drug trafficking.  The following is a summary of the programs being undertaken: (28) (scientific research on organized crime), 29 (international cooperation), 31 (special research technique), 32 (Listening and recording of communications and private telecommunications), 33 (seizure of criminal heritage), 34 (introduction of a regime of repent, protection of witnesses and anonymous witness), 35 (Judicial police), 39 (permanent consultation forum on financial and economic crime), 40 (deprivation of benefits), 41 (loot-related research) and 42 (international cooperation) (p.57); The fight against improper manufacture, precursor trades, and the production of synthetic drugs will be intensified. In addition, the importation of cocaine and heroin trafficking are disturbing. The possibilities of seizure and confiscation will be optimized via a directive of the Minister of Justice and legislative initiatives ... Any research on drug trafficking of a certain size will be accompanied by a financial analysis at the level of the police services and public prosecutor’s department (P.57); Measures should also be taken to prevent drugs from entering prisons, with due respect for human rights and the maintenance of the socio-emotional ties of prisoners (p. 68); The law now makes it possible to confiscate money from drugs (and vehicles used for the transport of drugs), and also to confiscate the assets and securities that have replaced them and income from the profits invested. (P.68); a reinforced repressive policy must be developed with regard to drug trafficking and criminal organizations linked to trafficking. (p.9);
","","","The objective is to arrive at an innovative, realistic and integrated policy, which addresses the judicial, economic, social and health aspects globally. In this context, the production of legal substances must also be addressed (p. 37); Belgium will advocate for the creation of a European monitoring system for drug and drug legislation and practices, set up within the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction (p.37); The Drug Unit will participate in the activities of the Pompidou Group (Council of Europe) and the various United Nations organizations (page 37)","N","","","","","","","","See table on page 39 of 2001 policy; ""The Belgian drug policy note of 2001 had no associated comprehensive budgets (1). Prior to 2012 authorities had funded three successive studies of drug-related public expenditure for 2001, 2004 and 2008. Estimates were based on a well-defined methodology. In 2012 authorities decided to start estimating drug-related public expenditure on an annual basis. The most recent study, concerning 2012, estimated that the total drug-related public expenditure (2) at the national level represented 0.16 % of gross domestic product (GDP). The total expenditure was divided into five areas (Table 1): law enforcement (68.8 %), treatment (29.9 %), prevention (0.9 %), harm reduction (0.3 %) and others (0.1 %).

o        Criminal policy must be adapted to drug users. It should be avoided that users who have not committed offenses end up in prison. (p.9)
o        ensure that drug addicted prisoners have access to substitution treatment. p.9
o        A regular evaluation of the results of the measures applied is essential if the drug policy is to be adapted to social development (p.9) 
Favouring a multidisciplinary approach:
o        Consideration must always be given to the fact that drug use goes hand in hand with individual and social problems: tackling drug dependence cannot be effective if the underlying problem is not tackled. In this sense, the multidisciplinary aspect is very important. (p.13)
o        In order to oppose the economic dependence of drug production, a structural economic development policy must be put in place in order to actively promote substitution crops (p.13)
o        Drug users who have not committed offenses should not be subject to entering prison. Prisons are not the place to treat drug addicts. The first objective of a prison is to ensure the security of society. Instead, drug addicts (problematic) who are dealing with the police or the judicial system, should be reoriented, first and foremost, towards assistance.

The Federal Drug Policy Note’s main goal is the prevention and limitation of risks for drug users, their environment and society as a whole. Three pillars are used to articulate the comprehensive approach taken, covering the areas of: (i) prevention of drug consumption; (ii) harm reduction, assistance and re-integration; and (iii) enforcement. In addition, provision was made for the establishment of a system of coordination units at the federal level, integrating representatives of the federal state, the regions and the communities. The five main principles of Belgian drug policy are stated in the Federal Drug Policy Note: (i) a global and integrated approach; (ii) evaluation, epidemiology and scientific research; (iii) prevention for non-users and risk reduction for problematic drug use; (iv) treatment, risk reduction and reintegration for problematic users; and (v) repression of producers and traffickers (EMCDDA, http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/countries/belgium#expenditure)

In 2012 authorities decided to start estimating drug-related public expenditure on an annual basis. The most recent study, concerning 2012, estimated that the total drug-related public expenditure (2) at the national level represented 0.16 % of gross domestic product (GDP). The total expenditure was divided into five areas (Table 1): law enforcement (68.8 %), treatment (29.9 %), prevention (0.9 %), harm reduction (0.3 %) and others (0.1 %).

As a result, the Communal Declaration can be considered a more up-to-date elaboration of Belgian policy, rather than a replacement of the earlier document. In this sense, the action points stated in the Federal Drug Policy Note were assessed in terms of the extent to which they had been achieved, with additional steps to be taken, in the Communal Declaration. There are three overarching measures in the Communal Declaration: (i) a global and integrated approach; (ii) scientific research; and (iii) international coherence. Three pillars are used to structure action: (i) prevention, early detection and early intervention; (ii) treatment and harm reduction; (iii) repression (as a last resort). Priorities are focused on different groups within the three pillars, with prevention targeting non-(problematic) users; treatment, risk-reduction and reintegration aimed at problematic users; and repressive measures directed at producers and traffickers.

In the residential sector, therapy and counseling are essentially referring to the care offered by socio-therapeutic institutions as well as psychiatric and acute somatic care provided by psychiatric institutions and hospitals. In addition, professional integration, self-help (eg, Alcoholics Anonymous), aftercare, volunteer assistance and specific offers (eg prescription treatment for addictions in case of dependence Opiates or smoking cessation) also play an important role. (P.17); Psychosocial support in case of addiction is changing. In particular, the FOPH focuses its efforts on promoting the conceptual and technical development of offers in this field and, in the spirit of co-ordinating the health course, on strengthening collaboration with the medical and psychiatric field. (P.18); the FOPH encourages coordination and exchange between the actors of psychosocial and socio-therapeutic support in cases of addiction, and of post-cure follow-up and medical-psychiatric care. (P.18); The objective of the offers developed at the time - easily accessible contact and reception centers, needle exchange, opiate substitution and heroin prescribing, low-threshold facilities and supportive housing - was to enable the persons in question to free themselves from social exclusion, in order to preserve their chances of being able one day to undergo therapy. Today, risk reduction is no longer focused solely on heroin addicts in a situation of exclusion. It is also aimed at people who are integrated into society but who are exposed to significant damage or problems by consuming psychoactive substances or by borrowing money. (P.20); Reduction of risks and damages: Behaviors linked to addictions have less negative consequences for the individual, his entourage and society (p. 20); The cantons, municipalities and private institutions have therefore begun to broaden the concept of reducing risks not only to all forms of addiction but also to the potentially harmful use of psychoactive substances. (P.20); Mostly applied to illegal substances so far, the risk reduction approach - which consists of limiting damages linked to risky behavior and setting up offers that are not accessible only to abstinents - must be extended to all forms of addiction where this seems appropriate and necessary. (p.21); Prevention of communicable diseases: the FOPH encourages the exchange of knowledge and experience in the prevention, diagnosis, detection and treatment of communicable diseases (hepatitis B and C, HIV), and will prepare recommendations on these subjects with the assistance of specialists (p.21);  by institutionalizing the exchange of knowledge and experience via specialized networks, the FOPH supports the cantons, municipalities and institutions in managing their low-threshold offers (eg Stay and consumption, needle exchange, job offers, housing solutions) and encourages the development of new instruments and methods (eg Drug Checking). (P.21); The FOPH is working with specialized companies to disseminate a concept to strengthen the teaching of addiction medicine in the basic training of doctors. (P.33); ","N","","The objective of promoting health and prevention is also present in certain measures to promote equal opportunities, for example, combating poverty, preventing and combating violence (domestic violence), support for disadvantaged children and adolescents, as well as other integration measures. (p.14); Reduction of risks and damages: Behaviors linked to addictions have less negative consequences for the individual, his entourage and society (p.20); Risk reduction measures also affect other issues, such as violence and accidents related to the consumption of psychoactive substances and their negative impacts on the environment, in particular for family members. (P.20); ","N","","The objective of promoting health and prevention is also present in certain measures to promote equal opportunities, for example, combating poverty, preventing and combating violence (domestic violence), support for disadvantaged children and adolescents, as well as other integration measures (p.14); To realize the objectives of therapy and counseling, it is also important to exploit the possibilities offered by the Internet, in particular in terms of interactivity, which can complement the offers of direct care and reach a wider audience (p.17); The promotion of interinstitutional and interprofessional collaboration as well as with stakeholders in other fields such as vocational integration, disability insurance, education, migration or integration is also an important aspect (p.17); optimization and promotion of the use of new technologies in prevention and counseling (p.18); In addition to measures to strengthen individual responsibility, the FOPH promotes a health-friendly framework, and works to raise awareness for measures not only used in health policy but also in other policy areas ( Eg, economics, education, infrastructure) that may have an impact on the population's addiction behavior. (P.23); the FOPH supports efforts to increase the awareness of continuing education institutions on the themes of migrants and people with a precarious socio-economic status. It is also a question of sensitizing them to the importance of integrating these themes in an appropriate treatment of the addictions (p.33); The Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) assists Infodrog and the specialized associations, in the development of continuing training offers for occupational groups concerned with addiction problems, such as professionals in social fields, education and integration fields, or gambling industry providers. (P.33); ","N","","The National Hospice Palliative Care Strategy hopes to increase efforts to improve the coordination of care for elderly patients with addiction (p.6); Strengthening health promotion and prevention among the elderly (p.10); Sensitization of groups at risk (p.11); Thirdly, the elderly, whose priorities lie in the preservation of autonomy and quality of life and in the prevention of disability and dependence on care. (P.14); Early intervention is an approach that seeks to prevent stigma and builds on the resources of the individual (p.16); Strengthen health promotion and prevention among the elderly (p.16); The FOPH strengthens its action in the field of health promotion for the elderly. It encourages the exchange of experiences and facilitates access to information and offers of support by these individuals and their families. It ensures that these activities are aligned with those of the National Dementia Strategy, the National Hospice Palliative Care Strategy and coordinated care. It places particular emphasis on already existing risk behaviors, which can intensify as a result of difficult personal events. (P.16); Prison health: in conjunction with other federal offices and relevant cantonal conferences, the FOPH supports prison health actors in their efforts to enforce the principle of equivalence, to provide the same care as the rest of the population. It supports risk reduction measures (e.g., needle delivery, continuation of substitution treatment), as well as general health promotion and prevention measures. (P.21); Particular attention is given to risk groups, ... migrant workers, persons with a precarious socio-economic status, and people in difficult times (eg separation, loss of employment or death Of a close relative). (P.35); ","N","","early interventions are used to identify risk behaviors and addictions as early as possible (p.5); therapy, counselling and risk reduction services are concentrated on the needs of the person concerned in order to get the best possible help and support (p.5); Prevention and health promotion, is a matter of strengthening health skills and individual responsibility. Thus, everyone must be able to make choices with full knowledge of the facts and to orient themselves more easily in the health system (p.6);  Strengthening health promotion and prevention among children and adolescents (p.10); Strengthening health promotion and prevention among adults (p.10); Promotion of early intervention (PI) throughout life (p.10); Optimization and promotion of the use of new technologies in prevention and counseling (p.10); Definition, dissemination and implementation of specific standards for the treatment of addictions in primary care (p.10); Raise awareness and information on the issue of addictions (p.11);  They aim to improve the health skills of the persons concerned and those around them. [...] First, children and adolescents, whose growth and development are balanced, and, for adolescents, the acquisition of a lifestyle conducive to health. Eating habits or physical activity behaviors acquired at this stage play an important role throughout life. By encouraging healthy habits at this age, adolescents and adults will be better able to make responsible choices. As such, family, school and training play an essential role. Secondly, adults, whose main aim is to preserve health, avoid diseases, and preserve and develop their place in social and economic life. (P.14); The objective of promoting health and prevention, is also present in certain measures to promote equal opportunities, for example, [...] offers of support for disadvantaged children and adolescents and other integration measures. (P.14); Strengthen health promotion and prevention among children and adolescents (p.15);The FOPH helps health promotion actors in schools and umbrella youth associations design and implement child and adolescent-friendly prevention projects to strengthen their health skills. In consultation with the actors, it develops the bases for the promotion of the health for children and adolescents, taking into account their main living environments (family, school and training, leisure). (P15); The primary objective here is to ensure, in collaboration with employers, that employees have access to health promotion opportunities. (P.15); The FOPH is reinforcing its commitment to early intervention, in order to quickly identify adverse developments, conditions and risky behaviors. [...]. Priorities in this area are the exchange of experiences, awareness-raising, and continuing education of professionals in the field of addictions, and professionals who are occasionally confronted with problems of addiction (p.16); Online consultation via SafeZone.ch: in conjunction with the cantons and the consulting institutions, the Federal Office for Public Health (FOPH) is continuing to develop the SafeZone.ch online consultancy portal and acts to anchor advice and information on the Internet and Virtual network between professionals throughout Switzerland. The FOPH encourages the development of information specific to addictions (eg via www.praticien-addiction.ch) and works on the dissemination of online self-management tools (eg self-tests ). (P.18); The FOPH supports the actors of primary care medicine in early intervention and the treatment of addictions by preparing the knowledge required for this purpose and making them available to them. (P.19); Knowledge transfer: knowledge acquired through monitoring and research is analyzed and made available to all stakeholders through congresses, publication of information on the Internet or e-mails (p.32); Promotion of practical tools: the FOPH supports efforts to continue to disseminate, in particular through awareness-raising among training institutions, the tools and methods available for dealing with addiction issues. For example, the FOPH supports the dissemination of the method of ""motivational interviewing"", which helps to stimulate behavior change in order to better manage his own health. (P.33); The prevention of health risks through information is one of the main tasks of cantonal and national health authorities. The FOPH continues to support cantons and addiction associations in their efforts to raise public awareness of addiction problems and publish information on its website. (P.34); Professionals and the public are actively informed about addiction issues and general health conditions. Risk factors are highlighted (p.35); ","N","","Creation and development of an addiction monitoring system (p.11); Drug Market Analysis and Progress Reporting (p.11); regulating markets for psychoactive substances (p.22); the FOPH creates the necessary conditions for the cantons, municipalities and other executive bodies to exchange experiences on the implementation of legal provisions related to the issue of addictions. (P.23); Establishment of the list of narcotic drugs: exchanges between health and customs authorities are intensified regarding the preparation of the list of illegal substances and the seizure of narcotic drugs (p.24); in cooperation with the cantonal police forces and other actors, fedpol monitors developments in the drug markets, in particular developments in the field of drug trafficking. (P.32); fedpol contributes to the implementation of the National Strategy Addictions essentially in two ways: by following the evolution of the situation on the markets for narcotic drugs, and by exchanging it with the other actors concerned, in particular with federal authorities as The FOPH and the AFD. (P.32);","N","","Representation of Switzerland's interests and exchange of experience and knowledge at the international level (p.11); the FOPH sets up a monitoring system using existing data sources (eg the Swiss Health Survey, police crime statistics, hospital medical statistics or wastewater analysis) (Eg Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey or the act-info treatment statistic). In doing so, it ensures compliance with international standards so that this system is most compatible with international surveys such as the European Drugs Report. (P.32); Switzerland actively participates in international efforts to strengthen public health and privileges the international exchange of experience and knowledge. The Swiss foreign policy on health, which is the instrument guaranteeing coordination between the health policy, external policy and development cooperation policy objectives, is an important guide for its implementation. (P.37); Switzerland defends its interests and the objectives of the National Strategy Addictions in intergovernmental organizations or organizations (UN, WHO, UNODC, EU, Council of Europe, OECD). This includes both legally binding conventions (in the areas of illegal drugs and tobacco) and its collaboration with international strategies, action plans and the follow-up committees, and recommendations emanating from them (particularly in the fields of narcotics, Alcohol and tobacco). (P.37); on request or on its own initiative, the FOPH organizes and maintains bilateral and multilateral contacts on the policy of addictions with governmental representations and foreign delegations. (P.37); Switzerland actively participates in the work of international bodies or working groups which play an important role in the exchange of experience and knowledge. The FOPH makes the information acquired in this framework available to its national partners. (P.37); Switzerland implements commitments made at the international level, and coordinates its action with international strategies, action plans and recommendations. It processes the knowledge gained through its international relations so that it can be integrated into its national bodies and processes.

(p.18); Healthcare includes inpatient centres specialised in addiction issues in Saléand Casablanca, as well as mobile units offering medical and psychological care in Rabat, Tangiers, Tetouan, Oujda, Nador, and Marrakesh, as well as harm reduction centres (p.21); Moreover, in 2010, the programme for methadone substitution was initiated in three pilot locations (Tangiers, Sale, and Casablanca), with the support of the MedNET network and of the Pompidou Group for the training of the medical staff. This type of treatment is part of the National Risk Reduction Programme in Morocco (“Programme National de Réduction des Risques au Maroc”). […] This type of substitution programme received very positive feedback in 2011. Consequently, the government approved its extension to sever further cities (Oujda, Rabat, Marrakech, Tetouan, Nador, Al Hoceima et Agadir). (p.22); Morocco is amongst those countries which do have functioning needle exchange programmes and where opioid substitution therapy is being developed. (p.25); A needle exchange programme was also implemented by the National Centre for Addiction Treatment, Prevention and Research. The programme has several objectives: 1) Awareness raising and education in locations where IDUs use. 2) Distribution of injection kits and condoms. 3) Needle collection. 4) HIV and screening. 5) Medical care (p.25); To this end, the Knowledge Hub Arrazi participates n various activities, such as: 1) Preparing and providing classes, training, and workshops in the fields of reducing the negative consequences of drug use and fighting HIV/Aids. 2) Developing region-specific material. 3) Promoting and implementing harm reduction initiatives and programmes. 4) Collecting and disseminating information on these initiatives and the regional and international developments in the field of harm reduction (p.26); In collaboration with MedNET, two specialised degrees in addiction issues were created in Rabat and Casablanca and have proven both very popular and useful. The objectives of these training opportunities are to complement knowledge in the field of addiction issues and to contribute to the training of participants in the National action plan against drug abuse.

These key projects are further supported by other projects to combat economic insecurity and poverty by encouraging human development in the overall context of the National Human Development Initiative (Initiative National du Développement Humain, INDH). (p.11); Since 2009, a government programme for alternative development has been implemented in Morocco’s Northern provinces. Various projects focused on socioeconomic and environmental development have been launched in over 74 target rural communities. (p.11); Morocco’s policy for the detection and enforcement of drug-related offences is based on a comprehensive strategy for alternative development and on a crop substitution programme with a budget of 85 million euros, which enabled the implementation of projects focused on socioeconomic and environmental development in 74 rural communities.

The objectives of this programme were[…] 5) Combatting the stigmatisation of drug users. (p.18); 
","N","","Morocco has developed its anti-drug policy based on a strategy focused on reducing offer, curbing both trafficking and demand, and the implementation of measures designed to encourage alternative development (p.10); One of the most important drug-related laws in Morocco is the dahir establishing law No. 1-73-282 of 21 May 1974, punishing drug addiction. It punishes both possession and use of substances or plants categorized as a narcotic and the act of facilitating by any means the use of these substances or plants. (p.15); Article 8 of this law takes into account addicts’ interests as it does acknowledge the importance of treatment and care of narcotics addicts. Indeed, this Article provides that “criminal prosecution will not be brought if the author of the crime, following a medical exam performed at the request of the Royal Prosecutor, consents to go into treatment for drug addiction for as long as is needed […] and that “the investigating judge can, on the advice of the Royal Prosecutor, compel treatment"" [...] Article 8 also provides for the exceptional possibility, where the defendant is a minor, to “provide treatment in a family setting, and in conformity with the conditions determined by order of the Minister of Justice made after consulting with the Ministry of Health”. However, in practice, the measures provided for in Article 8 are only very rarely implemented (p.15); The creation of “clubs de la citoyenneté” constitutes the premises for national action in terms of prevention. Of these clubs, the health club, communication club, theatre club and other clubs for leisure activities have been introduced in schools to be more supportive of students and explain to them the serious dangers of drug abuse. (p.17); The Ministry of Health has developed a “social communication strategy for the prevention of drug abuse” covering the period 2008-2012. The objectives of this programme were: 1) Preventing drug addiction amongst young people and vulnerable populations, combined with the promotion of mental wellbeing. 2) Improving the quality of the care available to drug addicts. […] 4) Treating drug addiction and rehabilitating drug users. (p.18); The Ministry intends to prevent addictive behaviours and promote a healthy lifestyle, notably by implementing a social communication strategy (p.18); A number of Moroccan organisations are also active in the field of drug prevention. This is the case for example of the “Moroccan Society against tobacco and drugs” (“Association marocaine de lutte contre le tabac et les drogues “) which led a number of prevention campaigns throughout the year and the country to raise Moroccan’s awareness of the risks associated with the use of illegal substances. (p.18); The Moroccan Ministry of Health’s strategy to tackle addiction is focused on improving the quality of medical care available to addicts, establishing specialised medical consultation units in the different regions, strengthening the care network, creating mobile specialised unites operating from teaching hospitals, and promoting youth healthcare centres offering psychological counselling in Rabat, Beni Mellal, Marrakesh, and Casablanca. (p.22); The national 2015-2016 action plan to combat drug addiction provides for the creation of hospital units specialised in addiction issues in Berrechid, Kenitra, El Kelâa Sraghna, and Agadir (p.22);

","","Morocco has developed its anti-drug policy based on a strategy focused on reducing offer, curbing both trafficking and demand, and the implementation of measures designed to encourage alternative development (p.10); Concretely, this strategy simultaneously stresses police action, the destruction of cannabis crops, including through programmes for the development of alternative crops, and the reduction of demand, which requires the development of economic alternatives, so as to slow the progression of cannabis production in Morocco’s Northern regions (p.10); The Moroccan government has thus reinforced police forces in the Rif Mountains and along the Northern sea borders to prevent drug trafficking operations and staff all drug enforcement checkpoints. Government forces now use helicopters, planes, fast ships, mobile backscatter x-ray machines, ultrasound technology, and satellites to combat drug trafficking. (p.11); Moreover, Moroccan law provides for a maximum prison sentence of 30 years for drug-related offences, as well as fines for lesser drug-related offences ranging from 15 000 to 60 000 euros. Prison sentences ranging from ten to fifteen years remain the most common sentence for drug traffickers sentenced in Morocco. (p.12); Morocco’s policy dictates that it firmly condemn the production and distribution of drugs and money laundering resulting from illegal drug transactions. (p.13); Since 2003, Morocco has adopted a series of measures to strengthen the enforcement of its law on money laundering, including the implementation in May 2007 of a further law on money laundering and the creation in Rabat of a Financial Intelligence Unit. This law provides for the obligation to account for suspicious financial transactions by any legally responsible agent, whether public or private, who in the exercise of his functions, executes or facilitates the movement of funds potentially linked to drug trafficking, human trafficking, arms trafficking, corruption, terrorism, tax evasion, or counterfeiting (p.13); Law No. 43-05, adopted and implemented in 2007, strengthened the national regulatory framework punishing activities linked to drug trafficking. The Unit can exchange financial intelligence on money laundering and financing terrorism with foreign agencies with similar competences. (p.14); The dahir of 3 October 1977 (amended by No. 1993/52) created the National Commission on Narcotics (Commission Nationale des Stupéfiants). This Commission is made up of the various government departments in charge of the medical and social fields or of enforcement. Its mission is to monitor legal psychoactive substances, punish the cultivation, commercialisation, and trafficking of illegal drugs, and implement a policy to prevent drug abuse. (p.15);

(p.27); Hence, Morocco has ratified various United Nations conventions on narcotics and psychotropic substances (1961, 1971, and 1988) and the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (2000). (p.27); In accordance with the United Nations’ recommendations, Morocco, as early as 1977, implemented an institutional framework in charge of coordinating the measures taken to fight drug trafficking and addiction, including through the creation of National Narcotics Commission. UNODC’s participation in surveys on cannabis in Morocco testifies to Morocco’s willingness to include the international community and donors in its anti-drugs efforts. (p.27); Morocco maintains a close relationship with the International Narcotic Control Board (INCB), whose reports also highlights Morocco’s efforts and the progress made in destroying crops and the fight against drugs. (p.27); Morocco further collaborates very closely with the MedNET network (the Pompidou Group’s Mediterranean network for co-operation on drugs and addictions) which aims to foster co-operation, exchanges and mutual transfer of knowledge between Mediterranean countries and Pompidou Group European Member States (North-South and South-North exchanges) (p.27); The Kingdom of Morocco works in close collaboration with several other Mediterranean countries on the issue of narcotics.

The idea would be to ensure that the quantity of methadone corresponding to the required daily doses is available during the period of hospitalisation; the methadone would be kept by the hospital care team and distributed to patients on a daily basis. (p.69);  Moroccan harm reduction policy has as its main aim to “secure access for drug users to prevention, HIV screening and good-quality treatment and care services”. This aim was reflected in the field in (1) the stepping up of prevention activities meeting the needs of IDUs exposed to the risk of HIV and HCV infection; (2) ensuring access for identified IDUs to appropriate screening, treatment and care; (3) stimulating community responses to drug users in the fight against HIV/AIDS; and (4) establishing national steering of the harm reduction system in order to guarantee the complementarity and coherence of the whole.
