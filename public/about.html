                <p class='glossary-item'><span class='glossary-term'>Indicator: </span>A quantitative or qualitative variable that is used to measure changes across time and
                determine policy success. For example: the prevalence of HIV among people who inject drugs is an
                indicator assessing one outcome among a defined population.</p>
                <p class='glossary-item'><span class='glossary-term'>Metric: </span>A metric is a combination of 2 or more quantitative indicators and measures that help relate different dimensions of a variable. For example, the metric “Presence of needle and syringe programs” is made up of the following quantitative indicators: “the number of needle and syringe programs by region”, “the number of syringes distributed”, “the number of used syringes returned”, and “the number of clients enrolled in the needle and syringe program”.</p>
                <p class='glossary-item'><span class='glossary-term'>Domain: </span>A domain is the larger theme or category within which specific metrics and indicators fall. The CDPE proposes seven distinct domains to capture metrics and indicators used to evaluate illicit drug policies: Health, Peace and Security, Development, Human Rights, Demand Reduction, Supply Reduction, and International Cooperation.</p>
                <p class='glossary-item'><span class='glossary-term'>Health: </span>The health domain is comprised of a set of metrics that assess the impact of interventions to reduce the harms associated with unsafe drug use practices, such as the presence of needle and syringe programs and medication assisted treatment. Metrics in the health domain also assess drug-related health outcomes such as HIV prevalence and incidence, as well as overdoses among people who use drugs.</p>
                <p class='glossary-item'><span class='glossary-term'>Peace and Security: </span>The peace and security domain is comprised of a set of metrics that assess the impact of approaches to improve community safety and security related to drug use and traffic. Metrics are used to determine the rates of violence and crime related to drug activities, such as the prevalence of accidents related to drug use, the prevalence of acquisitive crime, and the number of drug-related homicides and disappearances.</p>
                <p class='glossary-item'><span class='glossary-term'>Development: </span>The development domain is comprised of a set of metrics that assess the government’s impact on development of communities. This includes measures of the provision of alternative livelihood programs to provide a form of financial security for people formerly subsisting on illegal drug production, by providing housing and social programmes to reduce poverty and homelessness or providing vocational skills training to support individuals participating in illegal drug economies to enter the workforce.</p>
                <p class='glossary-item'><span class='glossary-term'>Human Rights: </span>The human rights domain is comprised of a set of metrics that assess the impact of programmes that promote human rights and contributes to creating equality, such as the presence of special programmes that have been implemented to help vulnerable and marginalized groups and the presence of medication assisted treatments available in prisons.</p>
                <p class='glossary-item'><span class='glossary-term'>Demand Reduction: </span>The demand reduction domain is comprised of a set of metrics that assess drug use and the availability of prevention and addiction treatment programmes. These include measures to estimate the number of people who use drugs, the presence of prevention programming in law enforcement, the proportion of people enrolled in compulsory addiction treatment, the level of coverage of non-medication assisted treatment (MAT) or an unspecified treatment, and the prevalence of drug use by type.</p>
                <p class='glossary-item'><span class='glossary-term'>International Cooperation: </span>The international cooperation domain is comprised of a set of metrics that assess the level of a country’s engagement with other countries to reduce the harms associated with drug-related activities. Examples of specific indicators are the number of bilateral or multilateral meetings attended related to drugs or drug policy, the level of participation in international agreements and the number of agreements signed.</p>
                <p class='glossary-item'><span class='glossary-term'>United Nations Office on Drugs &amp; Crime (UNODC) data: </span>“One of the key tasks of UNODC is to produce and disseminate accurate statistics on drugs, crime and criminal justice at the international level. UNODC also works to strengthen national capacities to produce, disseminate and use drugs, crime and criminal justice statistics within the framework of official statistics. UNODC regularly updates statistical series on crime, criminal justice, drug trafficking and prices, drug production, and drug use. Data disseminated by UNODC are mainly sourced from national statistical systems. Data on drugs are submitted through the Annual Report Questionnaire (ARQ) and the Individual Drug Seizure (IDS) reports, while data on crime and criminal justice are supplied through the annual United Nations Survey on Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems (UN-CTS). UNODC processes data to increase data comparability and to produce regional and global estimates.”</p>
