The farmers‟ associations are to better represent their interests, to provide access to credit (together with Agriculture Development Fund, and to play a role in development of markets, seeds and livestock. Also support the establishment of women‟s associations and resource centres {p.37} ~ Build strategic reserves for grain through local procurement which would improve food security and provide incentives for the farmer to grow wheat and other commodities and supply it to MAIL based on contract. {p.37} ~ Encouraging import substitution where Afghanistan can competitively produce food products currently being supplied from elsewhere. This would include procurement of wheat by WFP and emergency supplies by OCHA, UNHCR and other UN agencies and procurement of general nature by ISAF/NATO {p.37} ~ Focusing especially on high-value crop horticultural crops that can offer farmers returns comparable with the expected risk-adjusted returns from poppy cultivation {p.37} ~ Reintroduction of industrial crops such as cotton, sugar beets, oilseed crops on a vast scale in the northern plains and southern plains. As cotton and sugar beets require a lot of water, they can re-introduced along the southern loop of Helmand River Basin and along the Kunduz River where the water could be used for the dual purpose of paddy rice and sugar beets. {p.37} ~ Sustainable and environmentally-sound utilization of medicinal plants such as licorice, heng, artemesia and carabia {p.37} ~ Improving land tenure security in order to improve the chances for licit crop production and to allow farmers to justify longer-term investments in new production {p.37} ~ Establishment of food security plans, reforestation, rejuvenation of natural pastures and rangeland and equitable use of these resources (forestry, pastures, water etc). {p.37} ~ In the NRM Sector: Water Resources Development: Creation of employment through building water harvesting structures (by the thousands); Watershed management systems (for each River System in the country); Reforestation; Pasture and rangeland renovation {p.38} ~ In the Extractive Industries: Investments in the mining sector; Investments in the gas and petroleum exploration, extraction and refining {p.38} ~ In the Manufacturing Sector In the Construction and Public Infrastructure Sector: In order to create millions of jobs, there is a need for another policy and conducive legal framework to promote industrial development through public and private sectors, at public works (i.e. construction of railways) and in the mining sector; Vocational training is necessary to provide the skills needed in other sectors such as in the extractive industries, construction, agriculture and so on. Interventions by the HRD Cluster under NPP1 on Vocational Skill Training will pave the way for training of 150,000 unemployed, under-employed and illiterate population for the objective of preparing them for the labor market. {p.38} ~ Meeting the objectives of this Policy requires the creation of sustainable job opportunities, and the private sector will be the major source of those opportunities, in agro-enterprise and other sectors {p.38} ~ Lack of access to sustainable source of water for Irrigation is one of the key reasons why farmers resort to poppy cultivation.

The most critical missing link is cold storage for high-value horticultural crops and dairy products: Infrastructure (i.e., cold storage facilities at the village and district level); Grain storage structures. Post-harvest losses in Afghanistan are estimated at 15% which is significant meaning up to 750,000 MT of grain is lost. If post-harvest losses are cut down, the savings could go a long way for attaining food security in the country; Promotion of fresh/dry high-value horticultural and medicinal crops as “Organic Produce”; Access to domestic and international markets (linking small producers to the market); Introduction and promotion of “Contract Farming” {p.40} ~ The major task of rebuilding the country and searching for alternative livelihoods needs to be guided by comprehensive research, with reliable data subjected to appropriate analysis. The capability of the Government to undertake or commission applied research needs to be strengthened through active and dynamic partnerships with research centres of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)91, such as ICARDA, ICRISAT, CYMMIT, AVRDC and ILRI, as well as reputable research institutes and agricultural universities in India, Iran and Turkey. This research needs to be practically oriented, include socio-economic research and take into account the drivers of poppy cultivation in different part of the country. {p.42} ~ Legal Environment: There is a need to review / develop laws that provide incentives for private sector development. {p.44}  ~ Policy Framework: Should include a policy that consider grants to farmers giving up poppy cultivation, an employment policy promoting afghan-first recruitment in the industry sector, a policy to promote the development of industries (through grants, free land leases) {p.44} ~ Scale up and complete the existing initiatives underway by MRRD and MAIL so that rural communities would have access to a critical mass of support that would allow them to reorganize production systems along market-driven lines and to develop the physical and institutional infrastructures needed to support the shift from subsistence agriculture to commercial activity {p.45} ~ Environmental conservation of natural resources such as water, land, forests, and sustainable utilizations of natural pastures, rangelands and medicinal plants. {p.46} ~ ","prevalence of the Afghan population live below the poverty line, with per capita incomes of 45 cents per day or less {p.25} ~ prevalence of the population (5.7 million) that are only just above the poverty line and spend the majority of their income on food, indicating a high vulnerability to shocks {p.25} ~ number of communities mobilised {p.41} ~ number of registered CDCs {p.41} ~ ",,"Enhancing employment and entrepreneurial opportunities for women {p.26} ~ Economic Empowerment of Women as a Cross-Cutting Option: Investments in livestock under NPP-3 and NPP-4 is a first-class entry point for economic empowerment of women and diversification of the household income. High-potential mechanisms to improve value include dairy processing, sheep fattening, cashmere fiber development and skin garments. {p.31} ~ 5 Gender mainstreaming through equitable entrepreneurial opportunities for women under all AL interventions in order to strengthen and diversify licit sources of household income. {p.46} ~ ",N,,N,number of problem drug users {p.11} ~,,"To maintain the “poppy-free” status (i.e., prevent the resurgence of poppy cultivation) in communities which have consciously opted not to engage in, or have strived to abandon, illicit cultivation and production of narcotics (i.e., through Social Contracts) by addressing the key drivers of opium poppy cultivation {p.9} ~ To prevent the spread of cultivation to areas hitherto unaffected by narcotics by embedding CN measures, realizing the mobility of the narco-entrepreneurs who are ready to exploit vulnerabilities. {p.9} ~ It is important not to lose sight of the poppy-free provinces under this Policy because there are indications that the opium trade can still persist even if there is no cultivation taking place in a particular province (i.e., the outflow of narcotics across the Amu River through the northern provinces and the Afghan-Turkmen borders) and contribute to illicit incomes, impacting security, governance and fostering corruption in the poppy-free provinces {p.15} ~ -Undertaking robust analysis of the drivers of opium poppy production {p.36} ~ ","To achieve a steady reduction (25 % reduction after 6-years, or 5500 ha/year) of opium poppy cultivation {p.9} ~ production of opium poppy (in MT) in 2009 {p.11} ~ the cultivation of opium poppy in 2011 (in hectares) {p.11} ~ percent of illicit drugs that are intercepted by law enforcement authorities while the unimpeded movement of the drugs, precursor chemicals, money, explosives, weapons and insurgents across the Durand Line and the international borders destabilize the country {p.11} ~ Estimates (in USD) of proceeds from the illegal drug trade falling in the hands of the insurgents and warlords {p.11} ~ ",,"Advocate Global Support for AL It is well recognized now that the war on drugs can not be fought by GIRoA alone and that countries of the region and the world at large must assist Afghanistan in this global menace. Since a sustainable reduction in opium poppy cultivation can not be achieved without having the key pre-requisite-AL in place, it is imperative that the international community must continue to support GIROA‟s economic development efforts including alternative livelihoods. {p.33} ~ Advocacy at JCMB, Quadrilateral and Trilateral CN Initiatives {p.33} ~ Follow up with Russia on implementation of Rainbow-2 {p.33} ~ All AL partners and international development agencies are to build linkages with MAIL as the Lead Ministry under ARD Cluster and support MAIL during the course of implementation of the NPPs {p.37} ~ Enhance aid effectiveness: GIRoA and international partners to finance NPPs and channel aid flow through the national budget.

[...]  The information centre should not necessarily focus on law enforcement alone as it can also help citizens obtain information on drug treatment information for addicts or even can provide alternative livelihood information for the farmers {p.28} ~ Hold meetings at the district centers between tribal leaders, mullahs, district officials, law enforcement officials, and the Ministry of Counter Narcotics. This will help to build trust among people and will help to some of the underlying problems in the districts that lead to drug dependency. It is important to focus on helping addicts complete treatment; by engaging at the district level, we can identify the root cause and the underlying problem of addiction within the district. {p.29} ~ We should try to ask local communities to get involved and support Afghan government in combating addiction in Afghanistan. {p.35} ~ ",number of people who use drugs that are between the ages of 15-19 {p.35} ~,,"Improving poppy eradication process {p.14} ~ Implementing current bilateral and multilateral agreements with regional countries {p.14} ~ Creating better coordination for improving security and better border control {p.14} ~ Making trial meetings of major traffickers public in order to effect other drug trafficking networks {p.14} ~ Targeting High Value Drug Traffickers and Destroying their Networks {p.15} ~ The arrest of mid-level traffickers should be one of the priorities of law enforcement officials. {p.17} ~ Local councils (Jirgas) in the villages and districts play an important role in solving the farmers’ problems and will help us rescue the farmers from the influence of drug traffickers during the cultivation season. {p.17} ~ In order to improve social justice, our legal system must be fair and all court judgments must be according to the law without any prejudice. {p.18} ~ Arresting major drug traffickers should be the top priority of law enforcement officials. Regional coordination between the Counter Narcotics Police of Afghanistan and regional police is needed; we need to work together and develop a procedure which will enable us to arrest and prosecute major regional traffickers. {p.19} ~ Disrupting and Destroying Drug Trafficking Networks {p.20} ~ The Ministry of Finance should streamline the process for the sale of vehicles confiscated from drug crimes as soon as the decision of the court is received, the confiscated vehicles should be publicly auctioned. We should have an efficient, timely processed confiscated vehicles system so they do not sit in a parking lot for several years deteriorating and losing their value while awaiting sale. {p.21} ~ Creation of a specific guideline for seizing the drug trafficker’s vehicles, which will include the registration and timely sale of the vehicles after the final decision of the court. {p.21} ~ Creation of specific guidelines for seizing the properties of drug traffickers, including houses, hotels, restaurants and any other immoveable properties. {p.21} ~ Creation of specific guidelines for seizing the drug trafficker’s financial assets, including domestic and foreign currencies. {p.21} ~ Creation of specific guidelines for seizing drug trafficker’s shares on companies and those companies which are directly or indirectly funded by them {p.22} ~ Ministry of Counter Narcotics, in coordination and close co-operation with the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Defense, the National Directorate of Security and Local authorities, should annually draft list of major landowners that are involved in poppy cultivation. The Public Information Department of the Ministry of Counter Narcotics with the coordination of law enforcement officials and relevant departments should travel to provinces where poppy is grown. They should summon major landowners and worn them unless they stop poppy cultivation they will be prosecuted {p.23} ~ Local law enforcement must make sure that those who are summoned they are prosecuted if they continue to ignore official warning. No one should be exempt from this rule and government officials who interfere with the process should also be subject to prosecution. This will help implement the law properly and bring the culture of impunity to an end; everyone must be held accountable under the law. {p.23} ~ The Ministry of Counter Narcotics needs to come up with a comprehensive guideline in order to target major landowners who are involved in poppy cultivation {p.24} ~ Identifying and prosecuting of governmental officials who are involved in Drug trafficking {p.25} ~ In order to prevent corruption and ensure better job performance, all counter narcotics law enforcement officers assets and incomes should be confidentially monitored and recorded. Furthermore, their communications, activities, and affiliations should be randomly monitored. {p.25} ~ If it is established that governmental official are involved in drug trafficking or support drug traffickers, then we should have zero tolerance policy and prosecute them without any hesitation {p.25} ~ Targeting Provinces with Highest Level of Drug Trafficking {p.25} ~ We should include drug trafficking route survey with the UNODC/MCN annual poppy cultivation. Governors should be encouraged to focus on drug trafficking offences within their province as much as they do on poppy cultivation level.. There should be a reward and punishment mechanism for governors that substantially reduce trafficking within their province or ignore the issue. Special attention should be given to border provinces that are poppy free. {p.26} ~ First step- law enforcement officials need to have monthly joint technical meetings, where they plan operations on targets and discuss all the options. Second step- the planned operations should be executed jointly among the law enforcement agencies: Ministry of Defense, National Director of Security, the Border Police and the Counter Narcotics Police. {p.27} ~  In order to combat money laundering we need to identify unlawful money transactions and the sources of revenue before taking any legal steps to seize them {p.27} ~ We need to primarily target Afghanistan’s Hawala system where millions of dollars are transferred overseas without any trace or record. We need to impose a heavier penalty to the money laundering offence through the counter narcotics law. There has to be greater public awareness about the money laundering law and courts should impose the maximum sentence on offenders. {p.28} ~ Targeting street level drug supply  {p.29} ~ Identify and survey the locations where there are open selling and buying of drugs in the streets. {p.29} ~ Strengthen intelligence-gathering capabilities of law enforcement agencies to detect above activities. {p.29} ~ Establish fixed and mobile police CN checkpoints {p.29} ~ Special attention should be paid to small traffickers that are trafficking drugs in order to earn money to live; they should be asked how and who encouraged them to do this dangerous job. Collecting this information will lead us to identify the mid-level sources and other people who are involved in the drug trafficking activities {p.29} ~ In the first step all governmental vehicles should be subject to stop and search procedure because they are often used by traffickers as an easy option to smuggle drugs. Ministry of Counter Narcotics and the Ministry of Interior need to create a government vehicle stop and search procedure and sent it to the cabinet for approval. {p.30} ~ Another method of identifying drug traffickers is to track their written and electronic communications. This technique that has been authorised according to articles 24 to 37 of the counter narcotics and intoxicants law had a positive impact to some degree on convicting drug traffickers. Eavesdropping on telephone and internet communications is an effective way to identify drug traffickers. Electronic surveillance techniques are explicitly authorised in the counter narcotics and intoxicants law, we need to widely use these effective methods. {p.32} ~ Speeding up the arrest and identification procedure of drug traffickers {p.32} ~ Provision of a uniform large, medium and small evidence gathering bags for all law enforcement agencies. {p.33} ~ Creation of a procedure for rapid and safe transfer of major traffickers to CJTF. {p.33} ~ Provision of a standard arrest form for all counter narcotics law enforcement agencies. {p.33} ~ Creation of a register form for all moveable and immoveable assets of arrested drug trafficker. {p.33} ~ Creation of a standard procedure for sampling seized drugs. {p.34} ~ The key task here is that we need to restrict access to all unauthorised individuals from tampering evidence. Also we need to consider how we can safely tag and bag evidence. All documents including arrest form, prosecutor’s integration records and all relevant evidence should be kept safe and secure and no unauthorised individual should have access to them. {p.34} ~ . In the long run to deal with the drug addiction in Afghanistan we need to strengthen the rule of law, deal with supply and improve good governance. {p.35} ~ the law enforcement officials should allocate their valuable resources and manpower to arrest major drug traffickers rather than drug addicts possessing small amounts.  {p.36} ~ Destruction of seized opiates when there is no medical need for them {p.36} ~ Using seized opiates for medical purposes {p.36} ~ We should identify laboratories that are used to produce heroin, especially in the provinces where the level of poppy cultivation is high. The NDS resources should be used to locate and destroy heroin production laboratories in coordination with the CNPA. {p.37} ~ Countering precursors that are imported through legal border entry points {p.37} ~ Countering precursors which are imported through smuggling into the country. {p.2} ~ Destruction of precursors found inside the country. {p.37} ~ Precursors that are seized in the country should either be destroyed through a transparent procedure by law enforcement officials, or be used for legal industrial purposes. We should revise the current method of dumping precursors chemicals into the ground {p.38} ~ Establishing more Border Police check points. {p.40} ~ Equipping the Border Police with heavy weapons such as tanks and helicopters {p.40} ~ Providing operational/off-road vehicles to control individuals infiltrating outside of legal border crossings and modern equipment such as big lights, night vision cameras, search lights, communication devices and professional working dogs in the border areas. {p.40} ~ Providing capacity building training for the Border Police such as border control training, searching the vehicle and passengers and equipment which help us to identify narcotics. {p.40} ~ Identifying and closing the smuggling routes through the borders. {p.40} ~ Creating intelligence information in local residents among the tribes in the border areas. {p.40} ~ The sovereign nation of Afghanistan must play the leading role in preventing drug trafficking activities in the border areas; increased control of the border will help the ANSF, especially Border Police in arresting drug traffickers {p.40} ~ The presence of CN professional police in different borders and customs with good and effective equipment and trained dogs and the standard ways in borders is a vital and important need. {p.41} ~ Increase the size of the Border Police and increase the number of check points. {p.41} ~ Equip the Border Police with heavy weapons like helicopters and tanks. {p.41} ~ Providing operational/off-road vehicles to control individuals infiltrating outside of legal border crossings and modern equipment such as big lights, night vision cameras, search lights, communication devices and professional working dogs in the border areas. {p.41} ~ Providing capacity building training for the Border Police such as border control training, vehicle and passenger search procedures and narcotics identification equipment. {p.41} ~ Identifying and closing the smuggling routes across the borders {p.41} ~ Creating intelligence information in local residents among tribal groups in the border areas. {p.42} ~ The nation of Afghanistan as keeper of their county borders can play an important role in preventing drug trafficking activities in the border areas and will help the national security personal specially Border Police in arresting drug traffickers. {p.42} ~ Therefore, we recommend the establishment of an organized system of police operations in the Ministry of Interior and one of the main features in this system should be rewards and punishments for job performance {p.42} ~ Military forces will help to maintain security, Provincial Reconstruction Teams will help to reconstruct the country, and the neighbouring countries forces will help the law enforcement officials to target drug traffickers and prevent them from trafficking drugs into or out of the country. {p.44} ~ The following should be kept in mind while eradicating the targeting areas: Differentiate governmental and non – governmental lands that are under poppy cultivation; Consider the ethnic balance during eradication and prevent ethnic tensions; Consider whether the targeted areas are covered by alternative livelihood programs; Was there a public awareness campaign before cultivation began in the targeted areas?; Consider the weather and natural disasters like drought and flood; The Ministry of Counter Narcotics should provide the map of the targeted areas with the technical support of UNODC.; A separate target area for each province should be developed with the cooperation of the relevant provincial governor; The target area maps should be coordinated before the public awareness campaign process begins. {p.49} ~ The public awareness campaign and the eradication process should be closely coordinated. Many local factors in the eradication process should be seriously considered. {p.49} ~ For a successful poppy eradication process we must consider the following factors in the procurement and human resources plan: Scheduling a specific time for implementation of the process based upon seasons; Provision of equipment for the eradication process; Assurance of coordination for the relevant officials before and during the eradication process in the capital and provinces; Planning and being prepared for the unexpected; Seeking support of law enforcement organisations well in advance; Using local labour in the eradication process; Seeking funds to support human resource structure in the eradication process; Having trained and professional human resources on the eradication working team. {p.50} ~ Eliminating the name “trafficker” from poppy farmers {p.51} ~ We should consider tougher sentence for major traffickers including the option of executed or imprisoned for life. {p.52} ~ The Counter Narcotics Law should give extra authority to customs employees to interdict suspect transit supplies and seize the identified chemicals (precursors) that are transited to a third country through Afghanistan.  {p.52} ~ Precursor chemicals that are seized in the border or if the producing country is known should be returned back to the producing country {p.52} ~ Neutralising chemicals using technology {p.52} ~ Chemicals should be stored in special tankers, according to international standard. {p.52} ~ It is necessary to add a new article in the Counter Narcotics Law about prepayment paid by traffickers to the farmers to encourage more cultivation. The objective of this article is to relieve farmers of the duty to pay back those loans to the traffickers. {p.53} ~ The purpose of creating a trust fund is to appreciate the hard work of honest and dedicated people within the force and punish those who are simultaneously involved in the government and in drug trafficking. {p.54} ~ Creating a trust fund to encourage good performance, law enforcement forces will take their job seriously, have more motivation, and will take pride in their work. This initiative will help to combat drug trade and corruption in Afghanistan. {p.55} ~ It is necessary to create special cells for drug traffickers. Separation of traffickers from other prisoners will result in  preventing other prisoners from making links with the traffickers. {p.56} ~  For their correction and ethical behaviour, it is necessary to place them in separate cells where they have restricted access to other prisoners. It is essential that prisoners do not learn bad habits from professional hard criminals because it prevents them from share their experiences with others. {p.57} ~ When a drug prisoner (except for murderers) behaves properly during his imprisonment, his behaviour should be appreciated and after passing 70% of his imprisonment, they should appear in front of a parole panel and can be conditionally freed with bail and allowed to spend the rest of his imprisonment outside the prison. {p.58} ~To improve the capacity of CNPA, there should be a number of short and long-term training based on their needs, literacy and English language courses as well as computer training. {p.60} ~ The second subject is capacity building of the Counter Narcotics staff within the Ministry of Defense. They also should conduct short and long term professional training, literacy courses, English language courses, computer training, and short-term trips to countries like Columbia and other countries that have experience in counter narcotics so that they can learn from their experiences, including modern methods to detect and arrest drug traffickers {p.61} ~ Border Police’s counter narcotics division current numbers should increase to at least 1200. The border police counter narcotics specialists should be deployed to all borders and zones across the country and will take an important role in detecting and seizing drugs and arresting traffickers {p.61} ~ The NDS should be provided with English language and computer training courses, modern eavesdropping devices and it should have relationships with intelligence organizations of neighbouring countries and international counter narcotics organizations within the region. These activities will be necessary to build the capacity of this entity.  {p.62} ~ The law enforcement department of Ministry of Counter Narcotics is responsible for coordinating the activities of all CN law enforcement agencies. There is a need to build the capacity of this department and its staff should be increased to 25. This department should be provided with long and short-term professional courses in English language, computer, report writing, report collection and information analysis. {p.62} ~ In order to detect precursors coming into the country it is essential to provide well-equipped laboratories in the major zone customs offices and provide mobile laboratories services in other customs offices across the country. Training brochures about drugs and chemicals must be prepared for the relevant customs staff.

[…] Likewise, the challenges of development and its gaps make it necessary to work on the recovery and strengthening of human and social capital, which is deeply violated by consumption and its unfavorable consequences {p.10}~ It is also necessary to promote the articulation of actions with the country development project, to avoid fragmentation and isolation, to provide transparency in management and to facilitate mechanisms for accountability, to promote constitutional guarantees and to protect the essence of the Social State of Law, based on the effective exercise of the rights of political, civil, economic, social and cultural citizenship, with universal character, for the whole population {p.10}~ From this perspective, public policy in the area of psychoactive substance use, in addition to improving the physical and mental health conditions of those already involved, should aim to alleviate the associated suffering and to develop conditions that allow control over the factors that put at risk the options of life, the development of capacities, the health and the well-being. This means transcending the service delivery approach and engaging in the overall debate on the country's development agenda. An agenda that prioritizes the search for conditions for peace, security and overcoming poverty and inequality. {p.11}~ Social protection, thus understood, seeks to provide means to help the population more effectively manage the risks, and prevent the loss of well-being and depletion in human capital (asset sales, irreversible damages) for the most vulnerable groups, as well as the eventual loss of income due to a multiplicity of risks. To this end, prevention, mitigation and improvement strategies are put in place, and informal, market and public supply systems are energized with the participation of multiplicity of actors, including individuals, households, institutions, levels of government and the market. {p.15}~ Therefore, fostering opportunities for belonging to groups in conditions of vulnerability (prevention), as well as for groups already involved and recovered (mitigation, overcoming) will contribute to the construction and strengthening of social capital and contribute to overcome inequalities {p.16}~ At the same time, it is hoped to optimize the distribution of scarce and finite resources (technical and financial), thus maximizing welfare, and guaranteeing the right of to access all opportunities to prevent, mitigate and overcome the conditions and factors that make the risks and vulnerability to the consumption of SPA more dynamic. {p.18}~ Finally, social inclusion will be used as a tool to prevent, mitigate and, above all, overcome or deal with the ""after effects"" of having an active commitment to alcohol or other substances. {p.19}~ At the macrosocial level, it is proposed to carry out actions of social development, normative, cultural and regulatory deconstruction, control and social responsibility. It is recognized that this is one of the levels in which the greatest challenges are faced, since in many cases structural aspects are difficult to control. However, it is necessary to recognize that one of the factors with greater protective power is the opportunity to develop in a ""pro-social"" environment, sufficiently rewarding, to provide means and resources for the development of assets, to offer a cultural and formal protection that discourages the demand for SPA and protects against harmful effects.  {p.20}~ In the fields of rehabilitation and social inclusion, it is proposed to respond to the difficulties that many entities face for reasons of infrastructure and qualification of human resources, as well as reduce barriers commonly encountered by rehabilitated consumers to reintegrate into social life and productivity. {p.22}~ In addition to intersectoral and interinstitutional coordination and cooperation, as well as families and communities educated and sensitized to the importance of rehabilitation and social inclusion {p.22}~ All this also puts us in a scenario in which political action is based on respect for human and social rights, promoting every action that involves improving social cohesion and the inclusion of groups in vulnerable situations, ensuring access to media and real opportunities for social integration in both prevention and impact responses. {p.25}~ Within an integrated framework of development as a country agenda, social work requires the effective development of networks and synergies between policies and institutions in terms of social welfare, health promotion and strengthening of the aspects that contribute to human and social capital. {p.25}~ Therefore, the exercise of building a policy for the country in the field of social protection implies an inescapable commitment to guarantee rights, the development of capacities and opportunities, the fight against inequity and lack of social integration. This would make a difference in aspects that strongly influence the choice of substance use as a way of life for many children and young people of our country. Any effort in this regard contributes to the promotion and protection of human capital or, in other words and as stated in Law 789 of 2002, to improve the quality of life and reduce the vulnerability of citizens {Política Nacional Para La Reduccíon Del Consumo De Sustancias Psicoactivas Y Su Impacto, 2007, p.10} ~",N,,"In order to mitigate, it is necessary to prioritize the work with:[...] women of reproductive age... {p.22}~ In short, a political practice whose course is the pursuit of human development, the rights approach and the citizen's exercise, as a bet to achieve quality of life, well-being and reduce the conditions of vulnerability to a phenomenon like the consumption of SPA, is clearly demanding {p.10}~ The priority of the Policy will be any use of legal and illegal SPAs […] in pregnant or lactating women, in accordance with the principles of Social Protection and legislation. {p.17}~",N,,"On the other hand, and at the same time, with other countries, Colombia has experienced changes in the internal dynamics of production, traffic and consumption, which has forced to recognize that it is crucial to promote demand control efforts as much as those that control supply {p.8}~ If we want to move towards a more inclusive society, it is urgent to invest in children and young people, so that they have effective access to sources of well-being, security and equality of accumulation of human capital, precisely because exclusion reduces the choice of life and consumption appears as an option for an increasingly important number of young people in our country. {p.11}~ The priority of the Policy will focus on any use of legal and illegal SPAs in minors, as well as pregnant or lactating women, in accordance with the principles of Social Protection and legislation. {p.17}~ The ultimate goal of the policy is to reduce the incidence and prevalence of psychoactive substance use in Colombia and to mitigate the negative impact of consumption on the individual, family, community and society. Its overall objective or purpose is to offer an integrated, participatory, co-responsible, and effective response to the consumption of psychoactive substances and their impact, based on a common ethical, philosophical, conceptual, operational and management framework. {p.18}~ To intervene on a greater number of conditions, and macrosocial, microsocial and personal factors that increase the vulnerability to the consumption of SPA {p.18}~ The Policy proposes a general framework that aims to guide actions in prevention, mitigation,  and overcoming the risks and damages associated with the consumption of alcohol and other substances, with particular emphasis on the aspects defined as a priority object of the Policy: use of SPA In children, abuse of drugs and volatile substances, problem use and dependence on licit and illicit substances {p.18}~ In order to reduce the incidence of SPA consumption in the country, it is necessary to move towards the achievement of the first strategic objective, for which the operational axis of prevention is proposed, and whose goal is to prevent/avoid the onset and abuse of psychoactive substances at any moment of the life cycle. {p.18}~ Reduce the prevalence of consumption and mitigate the negative impact, requires approaching the second strategic objective and, consequently, the development of the operational axes of mitigation and overcoming, whose goals are: to prevent/avoid the progression of those who have already started to consume and transit drugs, to problematic patterns of or dependence (prevalence}~ To prevent those who have already started in consumption, and are at constant risk, of affecting their physical, mental, emotional, family and social health and that, because of their consumption, endanger others (impact}~ And to avoid that those who have surpassed their condition of active consumption by will, and have maintained a lifestyle free of ""drugs"", return to him (prevalence). {p.18}~ These components of health promotion and its sub-components (prevention, health education and health protection) will prevent and mitigate the risks associated with the consumption of alcohol and other substances, provide assistance and care to mitigate and reduce the risks of active and continued consumption and damages already provoked {p.19}~ In the context of social protection, prevention is a strategy to manage social risk more effectively. It is put in place before the risk is manifested and seeks to reduce the likelihood that an adverse shock will affect the health, quality of life and well-being of individuals, households and communities. {p.19}~ Since the goal of the prevention axis is to prevent/avoid the onset and abuse of psychoactive substances at any point in the life cycle, it is necessary to operate on contextual, situational, family and individual conditions or variables that increase risk and vulnerability to the onset and maintenance of licit and illicit substances use. In particular, those that are more predictive of the risk and those that can be intervened with the resources that have or can be enhanced. In the scenario of prevention as risk management, ""legal"" and illicit ""drugs"" exist, so it is necessary to offer the means to ""live"" with them by choosing not to experiment with licit substances at an early stage and, if they come into contact with them, that they do not try the illicit ones (prevention). If they are still in contact with them, that they do not move to patterns that are even more harmful to health and well-being (mitigation and improvement). {p.19}~ The micro-social level aims to work on risk and protection factors from socialization domains fundamental to the individual: the family, the school, the social reference group (peers) and the community in general. Strategies refer to the development and strengthening of the family, fundamental not only because it is a socializing medium par excellence, but also because exogenous crises are recreated inside, reflecting the risk and vulnerability of the environment and weakening its socializing capacities. {p.20}~ Other strategies refer to the construction of support networks in all the vital areas of development of subjects. The Policy recognizes that these are ideal scenarios for the development of prevention, but it also urges a revision of the perspective that limits, for example, the school to being an ""ideal"" ground for prevention, in order to return to its essential role as a socializing sphere and as a constitutive part of the social support network of children, adolescents, families and communities. {p.20}~ However, it is necessary to overcome the ""problematic"" vision of the young person (as proposed by the National Youth Policy), which distances itself from the subject's understanding and knowledge, indispensable for building a shared vision of the world and transforming reality. {p.20}~ The proposed strategies refer to the promotion of personal development and resilience, as well as to the creation of information and service networks, prioritizing social protection to children, adolescents and young people in vulnerable conditions, strengthening formal and informal mechanisms of protection, as well as social networks. This not only seeks to create support environments, but also to provide concrete means for better risk management, free access from barriers for groups with the greatest need. {p.20}~ In order for the strategies and actions of the prevention operative axis to consolidate the fulfillment of the goal, one must: 1) know the reality to be transformed, 2) involve stakeholders in all phases of the process, 3) act on the most predictive variables, promoting development, networking and integration; (4) diversifying and reaching out to all vulnerable groups; (5) continuing and sustaining action over time. The approach to populations and areas responds directly to the concept of vulnerability, which allows a variable approach to groups and people at different times of life. {p.21}~ Mitigation seeks to reduce the negative effects of risks, both before they materialize and when they have already done so and have become ""damaged."" To meet the goals, it is necessary to intervene in the conditions that influence the transition to patterns of greater commitment to consumption, to intervene in the installation of a lifestyle or the occurrence of risks and damages caused by patterns of harmful use to health and excess of self-indulgence, because the consequences are trivialized or because they catalyze sexual behaviors or high-risk use practices. {p.21}~ In other words, intermediate and pre-treatment actions need to be implemented in formal and informal settings (educational, labor, community and health). It is complementary to treatment services, and allows to reduce the risks associated with various patterns of consumption, as well as dependence, in cases where there is still no access to formal treatment for various reasons {p.21}~ At the social level, the policy strategy and health regulatory environments seek to mobilize the necessary, from policies, norms and systems, to remove potential obstacles in effective protection of health and well-being, as well as to facilitate cultural , contextual, normative, institutional or political change that is required. {p.21}~ The strategy of reorienting care and assistance proposes to flexibilize alternatives for care, assistance and welcome ""excluded"" groups from their incorporation into the information, services, assistance and social support networks. To this end, it will be sought to train the existing service networks, so that from the primary and basic care, it is possible to make early identification of problems associated with consumption, make brief interventions and referrals to the formal and informal service networks for the subject {p.21}~ In the same vein, the network strategy at the level of community intervention {see Prevention axis) will be aimed at guiding and assisting those affected to some degree, by the consumption of SPA, as complementary measures to the formal protection mechanisms, which will help reduce the impact of SPA consumption on public health, productivity and human capital. {p.21}~ At the community level, it is proposed to mobilize strategies for the promotion of social capital based on committees for coexistence and reconciliation, as well as for diagnosis and participatory planning and health education at the base, with which it will be possible to actively involve all parties of the community directly or indirectly interested in finding solutions to a problem that not only belongs to those who consume and their families, as well as to mobilize secondary prevention strategies outside the scope of treatment. {p.21}~ At the household level, the strategies described at the community level will provide the family with the means to better manage the risks and damages arising from consumption, and at the individual level, where components already described at other levels also operate {p.21}~ In order to mitigate, it is necessary to prioritize the work with: consumers excluded from any institutions (no schooling, unemployed, displaced, demobilized, etc.), deprived consumers, women of reproductive age, high risk consumers for using substances that offer risk transition to injection or high impact for health and community well-being, and consumers with psychiatric comorbidity. {p.22}~ In the field of treatment, it is proposed to adjust supply to demand and diversify treatment supply by geographical areas, socio-economic strata, genders, patterns of use and co-morbid conditions. It seeks to achieve an ""inclusive"" supply structure for the diversity of alcohol consumers and other substances that do not find answers to their needs in the style of available treatments.  {p.22}~ The strategies of overcoming refer to the treatment, rehabilitation and social inclusion of those who have developed a disorder of dependence to one or several substances, or present a problematic pattern of consumption in the absence of dependency. {p.22}~ The proposed strategies are based on the fulfillment of the objectives of the provision of service policy under the General System of Social Security in Health: 1) improve access to services, 2) improve the quality of care, and 3) Generate efficiency in the provision of services and achieve the financial sustainability of public IPS. {p.22}~ It is urgent to make efforts to expand the benefits plan so that substance-use disorders of high priority substances can be addressed within the system, for which it is proposed to focus and prioritize care in cases of high impact due to the severity of physical dependence, and strong linkage with anomic behaviors or high risk for physical health {p.22}~   It is necessary to mobilize networks and cooperation, in order to obtain means that allow the rehabilitation and social inclusion of the consumer, in which entities belonging to the Social Protection System can contribute to the achievement of the objectives of vocational rehabilitation (SENA) and Physical Family Allowance. {p.22}~ Create registration, monitoring and evaluation models for prevention, mitigation and improvement work. {p.23}~ Research planning should be based on local patterns to prioritize the study of vulnerable groups, the mapping of local and community resources, and the construction of contextualized responses. {p.23}~ One line is to apply high-risk approaches, as well as selective and targeted prevention (focused on groups most in need of vulnerability - not necessarily poverty). Another line proposes to use alternative methodologies, which allows greater control over the variables that need to be intervened to transform reality (management and social action). A final line consists of the creation of mechanisms that allow integrating efforts to act on multiple risk factors, and those  of a more predictable nature. {p.24}~ Broadly speaking, the policy seeks to control the risks associated with the consumption of SPA, to promote the creation of protective and pro-drug-free environments, to integrate actions to optimize the use of resources, to involve the base, so that in addition to living the problem is an integral part of the solution, to base and govern action in ethics and good practice. {p.25}~ The promotion of favorable and protective environment, demands social and cultural transformations, with the participation of all the actors and mediators who have something to contribute to the understanding of reality as well as its transformation, so that a participatory and co-management is possible, as well as an integrative approach. {p.25}~","% of population that has come into contact with an illicit substance at least once in their lifetime (according to the National Mental Health Study 2004) for the adult population, and youth population {p.13}~ % of university students who have come into contact with illicit substances, such as marijuana (National Mental Health Survey, 2004) {p.13}~ Average age of onset that youth comes into contact with illicit substances, such as marijuana and cocaine (National Mental Health Survey, 2004) {p.13}~ Lifetime prevalence (%) of marijuana between 1992-1996, 2002 and 2004 {p.13}~ Lifetime prevalence (%) of cocaine.

The situation is even more critical if one analyzes the last decade in which, despite a significant reduction in the extent of coca cultivation, the area of influence is maintained with a greater dispersion of the distribution in the lots, causing the involvement of a greater number of peasants in the business with a subsequent decrease of income per family. {p.29}~ Consolidation of illicit free crops regions: Seeks the final eradication, prevention of replanting illicit substance, and avoiding the displacement of the population involved in illicit crops to other regions of the country, by offering different legal alternatives.

It establishes guidelines or parameters for the eradication of illicit crops, the control of substances used in the processing of narcotics and creates a new institutional infrastructure, more robust than the incipient and rudimentary established in the 1970s. {p.12}~ Article 34, for example, stipulates that property acquired through illicit enrichment to the detriment of the public treasury or with serious deterioration of social morality is stipulated, and Article 35 authorizes the extradition of native Colombians for crimes committed abroad {p.12}~ The table shows that efforts in reducing illicit crops have been oriented at spraying and manual eradication, accompanied by alternative development programs aimed at promoting culture legality, and generating licit alternatives for agricultural production growers {p.22}~ This set of implemented efforts to counter the problem, parallel complementary work to combat armed illegal groups, who profit from the drug trade. {p.22}~ The results of the State in the fight against Criminal Bands of drug traffickers - BACRIM, show the permanent commitment to face all the criminal manifestations and, specifically, to these criminal organizations that have acquired a capacity of organization and affectation that surpasses the traditional models, given its high adaptability and transformation to absorb all kinds of delinquent manifestations, especially those associated with drug trafficking, the very essence of BACRIM. {p.24}~ The security forces have been confronting these criminal organizations, through actions such as: captures, deaths in operational procedures, seizures of arms and drugs, as well as blocking routes for the transportation of drugs and chemical inputs. {p.24}~ Both the National Police as the Armed Forces have the constitutional obligation to combat these organizations decisively, in order to protect the population and ensure the observance of the Constitution and the law {p.25}~ The crucial factors contributing to their decline are forced manual eradication, aerial spraying, seizures of drugs and chemicals used in processing, the public order situation, diseases and pests that attack plantations and alternative development programs. {p.26}~ In compliance with the policy of the eradication of illicit crops, the Colombian state has combined the strategy of aerial spraying, manual eradication, and alternative development {p.27}~ Consolidation of regions that are free of illicit crops: It seeks the final eradication, prevention of replanting and new plantings, and avoiding the splitting of the population involved in illicit crops to other regions of the country, by offering different legal alternatives. Among these regions are the Pilot Knot Plan of Paramillo: South of Córdoba, Bajo Cauca Antioqueño and Southeastern Antioqueño, Plan of Integral Consolidation of the Macarena-Meta. {p.30}~ Containment zones consisting of the joint implementation of preventive and coercive means to prevent the displacement of existing crops to other areas of the national territory, i.e., to respond to the balloon effect.

In fact, the controls exercised, the regulations issued and, in general, the interdiction actions carried out, have contributed to this. In this sense, the guidelines of this nature have allowed military, police and judicial authorities to prevent a proportion of these goods from being diverted to the production of narcotic drugs. {p.32}~ In compliance with these guidelines, the Colombian law enforcement authorities conduct daily seizures and immobilization operations of chemical substances used for the extraction and processing of naturally occurring alkaloids. {p.32}~ The fact that the use of chemical substances in drug extraction processes is far superior to seizures suggests the need to strengthen operational, administrative and judicial controls on the entry and marketing of chemical substances. As well as investigating and prosecuting corruption cases that limit effective and efficient control of chemicals. {p.33}~ Taking into account that in Colombia for more than 3 decades, drug traffickers have acquired considerable experience in carrying out their drug trafficking activities, national authorities must design strategies that prevent the transition of the production and trafficking of drugs of natural origin to those of synthetic origin. {p.33}~ Given the novelty and complexity for the comprehensive approach to this emerging phenomenon, it is essential to design and implement strategies aimed at shielding the Colombian territory against the establishment of synthetic laboratories and the emergence of groups specialized in traffic. {p.34}~ To carry out this process efficiently, we need to update criminal and administrative regulations related to precursor chemicals and the implementation of training processes aimed at administrators of justice on specific issues such as drugs. Further, it is essential to strengthen forensic capacity to work in coordination with drug observatories to establish early warning systems based on technical evidence, which will serve as an essential tool for more efficient intervention in both demand and supply. {p.34}~ It is necessary to train the interdiction control authorities for the possible technical intervention to production infrastructures, taking into account that the synthesis laboratories demand specialized knowledge for their dismantling, so as to avoid accidents and negative consequences to the environment.  {p.34}~ State policy has been aimed at blocking the transit drug routes, ensuring coordination of these actions meeting the objectives in strengthening strategic security and surveillance of borders (sea, river and land) and air traffic control by means of an adequate definition of roles and responsibilities {p.36}~ technical intelligence should be strengthened as there are lots of national territory, including land and water areas that do not have a Ideal surveillance {p.38}~ In Colombia, the profit obtained from drug trafficking has been decisively attacked through: (i) criminal prosecution for money laundering, (ii) expansion of coverage of the sectors required to report suspicious transactions to the Financial Information and Analysis Unit (Iii) adaptation of the Financial Superintendence to reinforce its actions in the prevention and control of money laundering, (iv) regulation of the professional activity of buying and selling foreign currency and traveler's checks through the Comprehensive System of Prevention and Control of Money Laundering (SIPLA), v) creation of a special group of Judicial Police and investigators made up of the Technical Investigation Corps (CTI), Administrative Department of Security (DAS) and the National Judicial Intelligence Directorate, (vi) actions for the extinction of a domain for the purpose of depriving criminal organizations of the enjoyment of unlawful profits And (vii) strengthening of the extradition process, among others. {p.46}~ Reduce in a systematic and integral way the persistence of the conditions that favor the drug problem in Colombia and mitigate in a sustainable way the adverse consequences. {p.51}~ Promote the active participation of civil society, the international community and of the State to make Colombia a model country in the intervention of the World Drug Problem, by making the production, trafficking and laundering of its benefits unviable, and to reduce the conditions that make it vulnerable to the consumption of psychoactive substances and to improve the responses to its consequences. {p.51}~ Strategies aimed at reducing the supply and demand for drugs must be articulated and mutually reinforcing, keeping a balance between the institutional investment and financial resources allocated to policy control and reduction of drug abuse.

To this end, resources were mobilized from the Bank of Projects of the General Directorate of Public Health, as well as the Project Treatnet II to strengthen the formation and consolidation of detoxification methadone maintenance programs in the areas of the country where this was required. In particular, the programs of Quindío (Hospital Mental de Filandia, Clinica del Prado, CAD La Primavera) were supported; Santander de Quilichao (Hospital Francisco de Paula Santander and Quilisalud}~ Antioch (Charisma}~ Norte de Santander (Rudesindo Soto Mental Hospital}~ Risaralda (CADRI Mental Hospital of Risaralda and Dosquebradas). {p.12}~ Intervene with communicative strategies for behavior change with focus on local relevance, with the purpose of preventing transitions between consumption patterns, to reduce risks and mitigate the damages associated with certain consumption practices, in particular intravenous use and overdose {p.14}~ Minimize the following risks: […] 5) Risk of acquiring HIV or other blood-borne infection through risky sexual practice or risky consumption practices. 6) Risk of transmitting HIV or other blood-borne infection to a sex partner or to a network of consumers with whom they share utensils for consumption, or with those who do not have safe sex practices. 7) Risk of overdose. 8)Risk of dying after an overdose. 9) Risk of developing a psychiatric condition and/or physical co-morbidity worsening. 10) For not being detected and/or treated on time {p.19}~ Since the strategic line of prevention focuses on the risks as part of primary and secondary prevention actions, this focuses on the harm reduction through assistance, comprehensive care and the provision of resources and inputs, to enable consumers and their networks not only to prevent risks but reduce the damage when already consumed, to improve the impact on health and well-being. {p.20}~ The following harms to reduce are: 1) Harms associated with constant venipuncture in unsafe and unhygienic conditions. 2) Harms associated with the exchange and reuse of injection equipment and other non-sterile inputs to consume. 3) Harms due to an untimely diagnosis of physical comorbidities. 4) Harms due to an untimely diagnosis of psychiatric comorbidities. 5) Harms due to the discontinuity of drug-assisted treatment. 6) Harms due to non-adherence to treatments such as TAR (Antiretroviral Treatment) or TBC (Tuberculosis treatment) or others. 7) Harms due to overdose not detected on time or not treated adequately. {p.21}~ Likewise, it seeks to improve the capacity of specialized services (CAD type, SPA care services or mental health units) to integrate assisted treatment with medications, in order to improve adherence and treatment efficiency. Opiate-assisted treatments should be included as part of care for heroin-dependent consumers; these treatments, in order to be conceived as such, must retain the constant of comprehensive psychosocial care that will not only be limited to the prescription of drugs {p.23}~ This line also seeks to improve responsiveness and networking, integrating key actors to minimize barriers to access essential drugs such as methadone. This is the case of basic care units, mobile units (CAMAD type), pharmacies, community services (eg type A under the PFMC - CHF) (after compliance with the requirements of distribution of special control medicines) {p.23}~ Also, as part of the actions of this line, is the management of medicines and other inputs, is an essential aspect to expand the therapeutic alternatives, reduce the risks of shortages, the diversion of medicines with the consequent development of ""black market"", such as the risks of accidental overdoses, among others. {p.24}~ This Plan proposes to place an important emphasis on strengthening the capacities of local technical and community teams, starting with health workers and community peer operators. It is proposed that each person in the System who contacts a heroin or IDU consumer knows how to identify the risk, how to approach it, what to investigate, where and how to remit. Minimizing the number of missed opportunities for timely, appropriate and comprehensive attention to consumption patterns with high health impact will lead to a significant reduction in risks, damages, and social and health-related costs. {p.25}~ Actions are also proposed to strengthen vigilance and early warnings associated with these patterns of use, as well as blood-borne infections commonly associated with them and other adverse health consequences. {p.25}~ Reduce the incidence of high-impact consumption for public health and minimize the risks to the physical, mental and social health associated with this consumption. {p.26}~ Early detection and intervention of high-risk cases (including promotion of demand for counselling and voluntary testing (APV) services) {p.26}~ 1.3 Availability of preventive measures (condoms and hygiene kits) and promotion of vaccination against HBV (rapid scheme 1/7/20 d) {p.29}~ At least 2 condoms and 2 hygiene kits per week per consumer are delivered to the program (approximately 1,600 users) {p.47}~   2.1 Distribution and exchange of syringes and other supplies to ensure hygienic practice & 2.2 Distribution of condoms: Syringe exchange programs and distribution of inputs operating in network and in program {p.31}~ At least 80% of IDUs identified as active in the territory are enrolled in the syringe exchange program {p.52}~ 100% of those active in the program receive at least two hygiene kits per week {p.52}~ 100% of those active in the program receive at least two condoms per week {p.53}~ 2.3 Detection, diagnosis and antiretroviral treatment, viral hepatitis, other STIs and TBC: Development of routine screening for HIV and other STIs {p.31}~ 2.4 Behavioral change communication strategies (CCC approach) and health education focused on interventions and delivery of inputs (condoms, kits and vaccines) as well as prevention of overdose management: Permanent development of CCC actions framing approach to street {p.32}~ 3.5 Accessibility to drug-assisted detoxification (preferably with opioid agonists) & 3.6 Accessibility for medium and long term maintenance with medicines: System of detoxification, care and assisted integral treatment with medicines operating in the priority territories {p.35}~ There is at least one drug-assisted detoxification alternative operating locally {p.62}~ There is at least one medium- and long-term maintenance alternative assisted with drugs operating locally {p.62}~ Strengthening the capacity of territorial, institutional and community response to heroin and other drugs via injected: […] 4.2 Training in screening tools, brief intervention, motivational interviewing and referral. 4.3 VCT training and treatment for HIV / AIDS with differential approach.

At the same time, recommendations will be provided on how to manage any suspicion of use, by first involving the family of the subject, informing them on the existence of a potential problem related to the use of drugs, and to activate healthcare operators of the local Department of Addiction which operates within schools through the Information and Consultation Centres (CIC). In addition, teachers must be provided with paper information materials and references online so that they can gain in-depth knowledge on the topic and easily find contacts for local services. {p.98} ~ 3.2.1 Activate meetings with parents in schools to inform them on NPS, the risks that their children face when using these, the ease of purchasing them on the web.  {p.96} ~ 3.3.1 Through the use of communication channel most frequently used by the youth (websites, social networks such as Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, etc.), messages to prevent the use of NPS are activated (banners, slogans, etc.), that show clear and understandable technical-scientific information aimed at developing awareness and perception of risks and keeping in mind that on the Internet there is a great amount of negative information easily accessible by youths. Thus, there is the need to provide them with “counterinformation” that allows them to be correctly informed and to assume responsible behaviours. {p.99} ~ 3.3.2.

Surveillance, early warning and epidemiology: Epidemiological dimensioning and monitoring of the phenomenon (users and profiles), of the type of substances, of the supply points and new avenues of supply, appears to be indispensible. Promptness and sharing of information is a strategic factor in a market in continuous and rapid change, such as that for NPS {p.82} ~ 2. Diagnostic enhancement: It is necessary to proceed to enhance the early diagnostic strength of laboratory networks and of emergency units and also of recognition of NPS by Law Enforcement, both through the increase of technical-scientific knowledge (specialised training) through both the increase of technological detection support and the distribution of analytical reference standards. {p.82} ~ 4. Enforcement against supply: Control, reduction and enforcement of the supply, focusing attention most importantly on the Internet, on illegal rave parties, on orders and transactions through the web by credit card, as well as in smart shops. Enforcement against the supply also occurs through the early and comprehensive addition of NPS into the list of drugs, in order to allow for the monitoring and the actions of Law Enforcement to combat trafficking, dealing and production. The deterrent measures and controls linked to them (i.e., drug tests for drivers or workers at risk for third parties or to acquire the driver license, etc., which punish the use of substances with fines) and the penalties issued for the illegal trafficking, dealing and production (with criminal consequences), are an important part of the balanced and integrated approach against the use of all drugs {p.83} ~ 1.2.1 Monitoring of the online offer of illegal NPS sold through websites, web pages or advertisements. Monitoring must be implemented in collaboration with Law Enforcement which are able to perform in depth investigations and potentially proceed to completely shut down the website, remove the single web page that is selling illegal NPS or remove the advertisement that promotes the sale of NPS. Online monitoring also includes sites that market NPS as molecules for scientific research or as laboratory reagents and which instead, often, are vehicles for the trafficking and dealing of illegal substances {p.88} ~ 1.2.2 Monitoring of smart shops. Control of commercial businesses where NPS may be sold as a legal alternative to illegal substances, under the form of incense, bath salts, fertiliser, etc. It is necessary to prevent with regulations that impede these offerings, said businesses from continuing to sell NPS, in order to prevent distribution to the population. {p.88} ~ 1.2.3 Monitoring of seizures. Control of the number of NPS seizures in Italy, of the quantity and type of products seized. This contributes to highlighting which products are circulating on the territory and are thus offered to users, as well as showing, in time, the supply trends. It is appropriate that the date relative to these seizures (subject to the requirements and limitations on privacy of the investigations) are reported also to the National Early Warning System to inform collaborative centres of the territory relative to the spreading danger for users and the DCSA to allow it to organise the response actions to implement to prevent and/or reduce the distribution of NPS. {p.88} ~ 1.2.4 Control of postal transit. Intensification of the inspections of postal packages, particularly those originating from countries producing or “assembling” NPS, to identify those that contain NPS. It is appropriate that these detections are reported also to the National Early Warning System to alert the assigned structures of the danger for protection of public health and the DCSA relative to the response actions to implement to prevent and/or reduce their distribution also potentially through special operations {p.89} ~ 1.3.1 Control of NPS purchases that occur online. It is possible to track, through advanced software, the orders and purchases performed online by using credit cards, identifying both the purchaser of NPS and the seller that received the money. {p.89} ~ 1.4.1 Monitoring is aimed at those sites and online spaces where the organisers promote illegal musical events (rave parties) where often new drugs and traditional drugs are used. Monitoring must be implemented in collaboration with Law Enforcement that is able to perform in-depth investigations and potentially proceed to prevent the event from taking place or onsite intervention. {p.89} ~ 1.5.1 Maintenance of a clinical-toxicological consulting reference centre for emergency units, available by telephone 24hours/day, where healthcare professionals can turn to for abnormal cases of acute intoxication of patients with suspected use of NPS. {p.89} ~ 1.6.1 It is necessary to enhance an institutional system for monitoring of the appearance of new drugs in Europe and in Italy able to activate, as needed, health warnings among pertaining structures for the protection of public health, that would activate prompt response actions to address the phenomenon reported. The system must maintain active flow of information at the national level, through their network of collaborative centres (clinical centres, emergency units, laboratories, Law Enforcement, etc.), and at a European level, towards the EMCDDA and internationally {p.90} ~ 1.6.2.

Drug users, especially those injecting and dependent on opiates, have been identified as an important target population for prevention. Formative research has been undertaken with international technical support, and discussions are underway on effective harm reduction approaches. {p.9} ~ . Recent research on most-at-risk adolescents highlights the need for formative research to identify such subgroups and the contextual factors leading to higherrisk behaviours (such as multiple concurrent partners or drug use) so that effective interventions can be designed and implemented. {p.9} ~ In the health sector, prevention services have mixed coverage, and further progress relies on health systems strengthening {p.9} ~ First, maintain and sharpen focus on most-at-risk populations, and scale up to 60-85% coverage; focus on sex workers & clients, MSM, injecting drug users, and their sex partners, and be aware of subgroups within these larger groups {p.9} ~ An important achievement was the establishment of a taskforce on HIV and drug use under the Lao National Commission for Drug Control and Supervision (LCDC) to initiate harm reduction programmes. The challenge for the next five years will be to operationalise the supportive policies and develop sectoral decrees, train law enforcement agencies and service providers on the implications of these policies, and monitor implementation and adherence. {p.11} ~ To maintain the low prevalence and avoid a concentrated epidemic among sex workers, drug users, men who have sex with men and their sexual partners, the challenge is to monitor risk behaviours, understand the predisposing factors to these behaviours, and better identify those sub-groups with the highest risk and vulnerability, and those hardest to reach (for example due to young age, gender or location). This requires strategic information, especially surveillance and formative research. The second challenge is to reach out to most-at-risk populations, many of whom are known not to access public sector health services due to stigma and criminalisation of their behaviours. Therefore, civil society and the private sector may be in a better position to reach out to them. {p.13} ~ Drug users need to be urgently targeted, especially those using opiates, as international evidence indicates that they are prone to injecting.

It punishes both possession and use of substances or plants categorized as a narcotic and the act of facilitating by any means the use of these substances or plants. {p.15}~ Article 8 of this law takes into account addicts’ interests as it does acknowledge the importance of treatment and care of narcotics addicts. Indeed, this Article provides that “criminal prosecution will not be brought if the author of the crime, following a medical exam performed at the request of the Royal Prosecutor, consents to go into treatment for drug addiction for as long as is needed […] and that “the investigating judge can, on the advice of the Royal Prosecutor, compel treatment"" [...] Article 8 also provides for the exceptional possibility, where the defendant is a minor, to “provide treatment in a family setting, and in conformity with the conditions determined by order of the Minister of Justice made after consulting with the Ministry of Health”. However, in practice, the measures provided for in Article 8 are only very rarely implemented {p.15}~ The creation of “clubs de la citoyenneté” constitutes the premises for national action in terms of prevention. Of these clubs, the health club, communication club, theatre club and other clubs for leisure activities have been introduced in schools to be more supportive of students and explain to them the serious dangers of drug abuse. {p.17}~ The Ministry of Health has developed a “social communication strategy for the prevention of drug abuse” covering the period 2008-2012. The objectives of this programme were: 1) Preventing drug addiction amongst young people and vulnerable populations, combined with the promotion of mental wellbeing. 2) Improving the quality of the care available to drug addicts. […] 4) Treating drug addiction and rehabilitating drug users. {p.18}~ The Ministry intends to prevent addictive behaviours and promote a healthy lifestyle, notably by implementing a social communication strategy {p.18}~ A number of Moroccan organisations are also active in the field of drug prevention. This is the case for example of the “Moroccan Society against tobacco and drugs” (“Association marocaine de lutte contre le tabac et les drogues “) which led a number of prevention campaigns throughout the year and the country to raise Moroccan’s awareness of the risks associated with the use of illegal substances. {p.18}~ The Moroccan Ministry of Health’s strategy to tackle addiction is focused on improving the quality of medical care available to addicts, establishing specialised medical consultation units in the different regions, strengthening the care network, creating mobile specialised unites operating from teaching hospitals, and promoting youth healthcare centres offering psychological counselling in Rabat, Beni Mellal, Marrakesh, and Casablanca. {p.22}~ The national 2015-2016 action plan to combat drug addiction provides for the creation of hospital units specialised in addiction issues in Berrechid, Kenitra, El Kelâa Sraghna, and Agadir {p.22} ~",the prevalence of drug abuse amongst 15 year olds in 2006 {p.10}~ Number of Injecting Drug Users (IDU) in Morocco in 2013 {p.24}~ Number of IDUs injecting heroin in 2013 {p.24} ~,,"Morocco has developed its anti-drug policy based on a strategy focused on reducing offer, curbing both trafficking and demand, and the implementation of measures designed to encourage alternative development {p.10}~ Concretely, this strategy simultaneously stresses police action, the destruction of cannabis crops, including through programmes for the development of alternative crops, and the reduction of demand, which requires the development of economic alternatives, so as to slow the progression of cannabis production in Morocco’s Northern regions {p.10}~ The Moroccan government has thus reinforced police forces in the Rif Mountains and along the Northern sea borders to prevent drug trafficking operations and staff all drug enforcement checkpoints. Government forces now use helicopters, planes, fast ships, mobile backscatter x-ray machines, ultrasound technology, and satellites to combat drug trafficking. {p.11}~ Moreover, Moroccan law provides for a maximum prison sentence of 30 years for drug-related offences, as well as fines for lesser drug-related offences ranging from 15 000 to 60 000 euros. Prison sentences ranging from ten to fifteen years remain the most common sentence for drug traffickers sentenced in Morocco. {p.12}~ Morocco’s policy dictates that it firmly condemn the production and distribution of drugs and money laundering resulting from illegal drug transactions. {p.13}~ Since 2003, Morocco has adopted a series of measures to strengthen the enforcement of its law on money laundering, including the implementation in May 2007 of a further law on money laundering and the creation in Rabat of a Financial Intelligence Unit. This law provides for the obligation to account for suspicious financial transactions by any legally responsible agent, whether public or private, who in the exercise of his functions, executes or facilitates the movement of funds potentially linked to drug trafficking, human trafficking, arms trafficking, corruption, terrorism, tax evasion, or counterfeiting {p.13}~ Law No. 43-05, adopted and implemented in 2007, strengthened the national regulatory framework punishing activities linked to drug trafficking. The Unit can exchange financial intelligence on money laundering and financing terrorism with foreign agencies with similar competences. {p.14}~ The dahir of 3 October 1977 (amended by No. 1993/52) created the National Commission on Narcotics (Commission Nationale des Stupéfiants).

Ten to fifteen years’ imprisonment remains the typical sentence for big drug traffickers convicted in Morocco {p.21}~ Under government policy, Morocco also firmly condemns the production and distribution of drugs and laundering of the proceeds from illegal drug transactions. […] This law makes it obligatory to report suspicious financial transactions carried out by anyone in a position of responsibility in the public or private sector who, as part of his/her duties, executes or facilitates movements of funds potentially linked to drug trafficking, human trafficking, arms trafficking, corruption, terrorism, tax evasion or counterfeiting. {p.21}~ To combat money laundering, the Moroccan government also set up a Financial Intelligence Unit in 2009 to collect, process and disseminate financial intelligence and co-ordinate the operations of investigating authorities, public agencies and other public-law bodies. […] The unit can exchange financial intelligence on money laundering and the financing of terrorism with equivalent agencies in other countries. {p.22}~ In concrete terms, this strategy puts the emphasis on police operations, eradication of cannabis cultivation, particularly through programmes to develop alternative crops, and demand reduction, which depends on economic development, to slow down cannabis production in the country’s northern regions. {p.86} ~","% of the prison population that had been charged with drug-related offences ranging from personal use to trafficking as part of an organised gang in 2010 {p.20}~ number of requests received for financial intelligence, and the number of agencies demanding the requests (2009-2012) {p.22}~ reduce the areas on which cannabis is grown by 65%.

The Commission's proposal will relate to the strategic work for sustainable development, both ecologically, economically and socially. {p.32} ~ Co-operation between the county council's drug-assisted treatment for opiate addiction (LARO) and social services is also needed to provide patients with both medical and psychosocial treatment as well as social support, which are important conditions for achieving good treatment outcomes. {p.51} ~",number of visitors who are registered in needle syringe programs that are in contact with social services {p.51} ~ ,,"Health differences between the sexes should be taken into account throughout the work of the Commission. Other health differences in society should also be taken into account, such as between persons with disabilities, LGBTQ people, persons with a foreign background, persons belonging to national minorities, the Sami people and the rest of the population. {p.33} ~ A group that has composite needs, and does not rarely end up in a particular vulnerability, are people with sexual dysfunction, ie both dependence and mental illness. The principals should aim to provide equal care and support. This means that everyone, regardless of gender and age shall have the same opportunities and rights to exercise influence over the activities. {p.49} ~ The people affected by the efforts of municipalities and county councils have important knowledge and experience to make use of in the drafting of the agreements. User organizations can capture users' experiences and point to shortcomings and key areas of development. Therefore, the law states that, if possible, organizations representing these persons or their related parties should be given the opportunity to comment on the agreements. {p.50} ~ There are also attempts at target group-oriented child health care for mothers who had drug problems during pregnancy, where children are adhered to school age. {p.53} ~",The number of unaccompanied children who are in asylum in Sweden {p.36} ~ number of children that have parents that drink too much alcohol {p.53} ~,,"The overall objective of ANDT policy is a drug-free society, with reduced medical and social damage caused by alcohol and with one reduced tobacco consumption. {p.29} ~ The overall objective of public health policy to create social conditions for good health on equal terms for the entire population applies also to people living in a socially vulnerable situation as a result of addiction. The general preventive work therefore needs to be complemented with efforts to reach this group. Only then can public health goals be achieved. {p.30} ~ In terms of drugs, doping and tobacco, the goal is to reduce all use. {p.30} ~ It is important to take into account gender, age, socioeconomic affiliation and place of residence in all ANDT work, as these factors are crucial for whether or not prevention measures will be effective. {p.31} ~ It is therefore of strategic importance to have knowledge of the factors that affect addiction and how they differ in terms of men and women. Both regarding the occurrence of addiction and its effect on health {p.31} ~ The Government believes that both gender and gender equality should be systematically taken into account in both the implementation and follow-up of the ANDT strategy. It is important that health promotion and preventive ANDT efforts focus on addressing gender differences and respond to gender-based individual and / or group-specific needs and conditions, as well as taking into account other socio-economic or demographic differences with regard to ANDT consumption or harmfulness to followed by ANDT. To support such work, the indicator system needs to be developed, partly to ensure that all statistics are gender-segregated and that it supports the follow-up of developments in different socio-economic and demographic groups (see section Development of Organization for Implementation).{p.31} ~  In order to strengthen the child's development, health and rights, the government has therefore set a goal that all parents should be offered universally and directed support in parenthood and in their relationship to each other during the child's entire upbringing. The county councils have the task of supporting municipalities, county councils and other parents supporting actors in the years 2014-2017 in developing a universal, knowledge-based, coordinated and long-term support for parents with children in their teens. {p.34} ~ The Government believes that it is important for initiatives that make it easier for girls and boys to pursue active leisure, especially for the most vulnerable children in society. The fact that young people have access to activities that give them meaningful free time can both postpone debut and prevent abuse of alcohol and drugs. The government's ambition is for children and young people to have better opportunities to participate in sports, outdoor activities and cultural schools. {p.35} ~ The government also allocates SEK 80 million per year to 2016 to introduce free entrance to state museums as well as 230 million to cultural activities in the million program areas, as well as SEK 400 million for the years 2015-2018 to make the municipal music and culture school more accessible.

An important part of the social action groups is to make young people aware of the risks of drugs and non-drug-based preparations. This crime prevention work therefore also has a clear ANDT prevention effect. {p.43} ~ It is important to strengthen prevention efforts through information and increased knowledge in sports-related environments to prevent the use, sale and distribution of mainly doping preparations. Efforts need to be coordinated to become more effective. {p.43} ~ A health promotion school is based on the students' different conditions and needs {p.45} ~ Completing the school is also the single most important factor for children's future health. Therefore, a safe school environment with well-functioning teaching as well as a preventive and health-promoting student health is of great importance to children's and young people's health development. {p.45} ~ Collaboration between school and parents as well as parents ability to engage in school, their expectations of the child and ability to support and encourage the child in school work are important for school results, health and well-being. By supporting the parents in this, the conditions for good school performance can be improved. {p.45} ~ The county councils have the government's mission to support municipalities, county councils and other parents supporting actors in the development of a universal, knowledge-based, coordinated and long-term support for parents with children in their teens in their respective countries. {p.45} ~ The National School of Education has the task of developing and implementing national school development programs aimed at principals and schools.52 The efforts relate to skills development and support efforts and include working methods and working methods to develop work on the school's value base, which includes security, study, anti-discrimination and abuse, and work for gender equality and norm criticism.  {p.45} ~ the government gave a special investigator the task of identifying pupils' problematic absence in elementary school. The investigator will also analyze the reasons for the absence and suggest how the school's work to promote attendance and take action in the absence can be improved. {p.46} ~ The government has also taken a number of measures to improve the results for school pupils {p.46} ~ The government's actions to improve school outcomes, to develop the school's value-based work and to strengthen and develop student health create the overall prerequisites for a health promotion school for all students, including for the prevention of ANDT. {p.46} ~ The aim was to promote a common preventive work against cannabis use among others, through skills-enhancing efforts among those working with young people and in care and treatment {p.47} ~ At the same time, the Public Health Agency was commissioned to compile research findings and evaluations of implemented drug abuse efforts and with a particular focus on cannabis abuse. It is also included in the mission to disseminate experiences and information on effective methods and strategies in terms of prevention as well as early action. The dissemination of knowledge shall primarily take place in municipalities, county councils and the non-profit sector. {p.47} ~  The County Councils ANDT Coordinators and the process leaders for developing addiction and addiction care provide important resources to support the municipalities and the county council's addiction and addiction care in its development of activities in the field of cannabis use and addiction, especially among children and young people. {p.47} ~ Attention and prevention of ANDT-related ill health among women and men as well as girls and boys in health care, social services and other venues {p.47} ~  Reduce the use and availability of anabolic androgenic stereos (AAS) and other doping preparations among training institutions. {p.48} ~ It is important for increased coordination in preventive work to come about among different actors to effectively combat doping in the athletic race {p.49} ~ Within the context of the ANDT strategy, it is essential that there is continued development work that contributes to available quality care and treatment. {p.49} ~ Care and support for people with addiction and addiction is a shared responsibility for county councils and municipalities. Since 1 July 2013, county councils and municipalities have been obliged to conclude agreements for cooperation with alcohol, drug, drug and doping users {p.49} ~ Early attention to risk use and dependence among prospective parents {p.52} ~ Damage to children caused by alcohol, drugs, doping or tobacco can never be accepted. Efforts to protect children against harmful use of others and others constitute a continuing basis for the health promotion and prevention of the ANDT work. {p.52} ~  In order to further increase knowledge, the state's medical and social evaluation (SBU) preparation will provide a knowledge overview of methods for investigation, diagnosis and support for children with FAS / FASD.

The Center also has the task of handling method development and assisting with some expert competence. This will strengthen the police's ability in counteracting drug trafficking, non-drug-based drugs and doping on the Internet. {p.40} ~  Collaboration between ANDT Prevention and Crime Prevention on all levels {p.41} ~ The government has initiated an effort to develop the wide-ranging crime prevention work. As a first step, Brå has submitted proposals for how local crime prevention work can be strengthened and developed through improved national coordination. The assignment is based on an analysis of local needs and conditions in which the need for enhanced regional involvement in crime prevention work, for example by county administrative boards, is considered. The goal is to have structured crime prevention work throughout the country. {p.42} ~ Furthermore, the Government intends to develop a national strategy for crime prevention work covering a wide range of measures during the term of office. It can be social interventions for those at high risk of getting into or returning to crime but also reducing the likelihood that crimes are committed by making the crimes less profitable, more risky or harder to perform. {p.42} ~ The Government has also instructed the Swedish Customs, Police, ECO and Tax Agency to map how authorities work to prevent illegal handling of excisable goods is conducted and analyze how cooperation can be improved. The aim is to create better opportunities for the authorities to ensure that excise duty legislation is not circumvented and handle extensive cheating. {p.42} ~  The work is aimed at strengthening the social security network around the young person by coordinating support for social services, schools and police. {p.43} ~ The prosecution service has been given the government's responsibility to develop and strengthen the agency's work on emissions in order to increase the client's ability not to return to crime. {p.50} ~","Trends of NPS trades, and sales of drug based preparations {p.40} ~ number of drug traffickers {p.55} ~",,"Objective 6: A public health-based view of ANDT within the EU and internationally. {p.36} ~ Actively promoting a public health-oriented view of drugs within the EU and the UN based on human rights policy {p.56} ~ A specific target area relates to improving efforts globally to prevent and provide care and treatment for people in addiction {p.56} ~ The Swedish Government attaches great importance to the need to improve the balance between efforts, so that the main objective, health protection and health improvement will be even more prominent in the policy area. {p.57} ~ The Government intends to work for the EU's development of a new Action Plan for Drugs 2017 to reflect a public health-based drug policy based on human rights. Sweden will also work in EU cooperation to make the EU's voice on these issues clearer in various UN agencies, UN reports and strategies. Sweden will at the High Level Meeting held at the General Assembly in April 2016 and in subsequent work ensure that a public health policy also forms the basis for the follow-up of the Political Declaration that will take place in 2019. {p.57} ~ WHO should work out and adopt a broad public health policy response to drug issues before 2019 {p.57} ~ A public health policy perspective therefore allows for a comprehensive approach and promotes a balanced international response to the drug issue. WHO's normative guidance also sets international standards.

Both Conventions as a basis to counter health risks of doping and cheating in sport. Swedish Sports Confederation and Cabinet Office is continuing work on the conventions. Within the Monitoring Group of the Council of Europe Convention, work is constantly under way to develop qualitative methods in anti-doping and to ensure the obligations of the Convention Parties in the Convention. Sweden and other member states of the EU and the Council of Europe, together with the sports movement, also participate in developing international work against doping in the World AIDS Organization (WADA) sport, including by contributing annually to financing the organization's budget. {p.58} ~ Within the ANDT area there are several forums for cooperation and exchange of experience between the Nordic countries. In many respects, the Nordic countries are equal, creating good opportunities to learn from each other. In other respects, politics differ, which also provides the opportunity to compare how different policy choices affect development. Nordic cooperation also provides the conditions for jointly driving issues to gain greater weight in other EU co-operation and international cooperation. {p.59} ~",N,,N,,,,Not available,Not available,"511,000,000,000 USD (2016)",,A presentation that summarises the ANDT strategy (in English) - http://www.government.se/49a303/contentassets/5538b583fd3745d8ac905799565b54c6/presentation-of-the-strategy-for-alcohol-narcotics-doping-and-tobacco-andt-for-the-period-20162020.pdf; The ANDT strategy from 2010-2015 http://www.government.se/49b757/contentassets/0e3caf84b1ff4a038ec70c3c9c4db2ac/a-cohesive-strategy-for-alcohol-narcotic-drugs-doping-and-tobacco-andt-policy.-s.2011.02,,

In the residential sector, therapy and counseling are essentially referring to the care offered by socio-therapeutic institutions as well as psychiatric and acute somatic care provided by psychiatric institutions and hospitals. In addition, professional integration, self-help (eg, Alcoholics Anonymous), aftercare, volunteer assistance and specific offers (eg prescription treatment for addictions in case of dependence Opiates or smoking cessation) also play an important role. {p.17}~ Psychosocial support in case of addiction is changing. In particular, the FOPH focuses its efforts on promoting the conceptual and technical development of offers in this field and, in the spirit of co-ordinating the health course, on strengthening collaboration with the medical and psychiatric field. {p.18}~ the FOPH encourages coordination and exchange between the actors of psychosocial and socio-therapeutic support in cases of addiction, and of post-cure follow-up and medical-psychiatric care. {p.18}~ The objective of the offers developed at the time - easily accessible contact and reception centers, needle exchange, opiate substitution and heroin prescribing, low-threshold facilities and supportive housing - was to enable the persons in question to free themselves from social exclusion, in order to preserve their chances of being able one day to undergo therapy. Today, risk reduction is no longer focused solely on heroin addicts in a situation of exclusion. It is also aimed at people who are integrated into society but who are exposed to significant damage or problems by consuming psychoactive substances or by borrowing money. {p.20}~ Reduction of risks and damages: Behaviors linked to addictions have less negative consequences for the individual, his entourage and society {p. 20}~ The cantons, municipalities and private institutions have therefore begun to broaden the concept of reducing risks not only to all forms of addiction but also to the potentially harmful use of psychoactive substances. {p.20}~ Mostly applied to illegal substances so far, the risk reduction approach - which consists of limiting damages linked to risky behavior and setting up offers that are not accessible only to abstinents - must be extended to all forms of addiction where this seems appropriate and necessary. {p.21}~ Prevention of communicable diseases: the FOPH encourages the exchange of knowledge and experience in the prevention, diagnosis, detection and treatment of communicable diseases (hepatitis B and C, HIV), and will prepare recommendations on these subjects with the assistance of specialists {p.21}~  by institutionalizing the exchange of knowledge and experience via specialized networks, the FOPH supports the cantons, municipalities and institutions in managing their low-threshold offers (eg Stay and consumption, needle exchange, job offers, housing solutions) and encourages the development of new instruments and methods (eg Drug Checking). {p.21}~ The FOPH is working with specialized companies to disseminate a concept to strengthen the teaching of addiction medicine in the basic training of doctors. {p.33}~ ",N,,"The objective of promoting health and prevention is also present in certain measures to promote equal opportunities, for example, combating poverty, preventing and combating violence (domestic violence), support for disadvantaged children and adolescents, as well as other integration measures. {p.14}~ Reduction of risks and damages: Behaviors linked to addictions have less negative consequences for the individual, his entourage and society {p.20}~ Risk reduction measures also affect other issues, such as violence and accidents related to the consumption of psychoactive substances and their negative impacts on the environment, in particular for family members. {p.20}~ ",N,,"The objective of promoting health and prevention is also present in certain measures to promote equal opportunities, for example, combating poverty, preventing and combating violence (domestic violence), support for disadvantaged children and adolescents, as well as other integration measures {p.14}~ To realize the objectives of therapy and counseling, it is also important to exploit the possibilities offered by the Internet, in particular in terms of interactivity, which can complement the offers of direct care and reach a wider audience {p.17}~ The promotion of interinstitutional and interprofessional collaboration as well as with stakeholders in other fields such as vocational integration, disability insurance, education, migration or integration is also an important aspect {p.17}~ optimization and promotion of the use of new technologies in prevention and counseling {p.18}~ In addition to measures to strengthen individual responsibility, the FOPH promotes a health-friendly framework, and works to raise awareness for measures not only used in health policy but also in other policy areas ( Eg, economics, education, infrastructure) that may have an impact on the population's addiction behavior. {p.23}~ the FOPH supports efforts to increase the awareness of continuing education institutions on the themes of migrants and people with a precarious socio-economic status. It is also a question of sensitizing them to the importance of integrating these themes in an appropriate treatment of the addictions {p.33}~ The Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) assists Infodrog and the specialized associations, in the development of continuing training offers for occupational groups concerned with addiction problems, such as professionals in social fields, education and integration fields, or gambling industry providers. {p.33}~ ",N,,"The National Hospice Palliative Care Strategy hopes to increase efforts to improve the coordination of care for elderly patients with addiction {p.6}~ Strengthening health promotion and prevention among the elderly {p.10}~ Sensitization of groups at risk {p.11}~ Thirdly, the elderly, whose priorities lie in the preservation of autonomy and quality of life and in the prevention of disability and dependence on care. {p.14}~ Early intervention is an approach that seeks to prevent stigma and builds on the resources of the individual {p.16}~ Strengthen health promotion and prevention among the elderly {p.16}~ The FOPH strengthens its action in the field of health promotion for the elderly. It encourages the exchange of experiences and facilitates access to information and offers of support by these individuals and their families. It ensures that these activities are aligned with those of the National Dementia Strategy, the National Hospice Palliative Care Strategy and coordinated care. It places particular emphasis on already existing risk behaviors, which can intensify as a result of difficult personal events. {p.16}~ Prison health: in conjunction with other federal offices and relevant cantonal conferences, the FOPH supports prison health actors in their efforts to enforce the principle of equivalence, to provide the same care as the rest of the population. It supports risk reduction measures (e.g., needle delivery, continuation of substitution treatment), as well as general health promotion and prevention measures. {p.21}~ Particular attention is given to risk groups, ... migrant workers, persons with a precarious socio-economic status, and people in difficult times (eg separation, loss of employment or death Of a close relative). {p.35}~ ",N,,"early interventions are used to identify risk behaviors and addictions as early as possible {p.5}~ therapy, counselling and risk reduction services are concentrated on the needs of the person concerned in order to get the best possible help and support {p.5}~ Prevention and health promotion, is a matter of strengthening health skills and individual responsibility.

[...] First, children and adolescents, whose growth and development are balanced, and, for adolescents, the acquisition of a lifestyle conducive to health. Eating habits or physical activity behaviors acquired at this stage play an important role throughout life. By encouraging healthy habits at this age, adolescents and adults will be better able to make responsible choices. As such, family, school and training play an essential role. Secondly, adults, whose main aim is to preserve health, avoid diseases, and preserve and develop their place in social and economic life. {p.14}~ The objective of promoting health and prevention, is also present in certain measures to promote equal opportunities, for example, [...] offers of support for disadvantaged children and adolescents and other integration measures. {p.14}~ Strengthen health promotion and prevention among children and adolescents {p.15}~The FOPH helps health promotion actors in schools and umbrella youth associations design and implement child and adolescent-friendly prevention projects to strengthen their health skills. In consultation with the actors, it develops the bases for the promotion of the health for children and adolescents, taking into account their main living environments (family, school and training, leisure). (P15}~ The primary objective here is to ensure, in collaboration with employers, that employees have access to health promotion opportunities. {p.15}~ The FOPH is reinforcing its commitment to early intervention, in order to quickly identify adverse developments, conditions and risky behaviors. [...]. Priorities in this area are the exchange of experiences, awareness-raising, and continuing education of professionals in the field of addictions, and professionals who are occasionally confronted with problems of addiction {p.16}~ Online consultation via SafeZone.ch: in conjunction with the cantons and the consulting institutions, the Federal Office for Public Health (FOPH) is continuing to develop the SafeZone.ch online consultancy portal and acts to anchor advice and information on the Internet and Virtual network between professionals throughout Switzerland. The FOPH encourages the development of information specific to addictions (eg via www.praticien-addiction.ch) and works on the dissemination of online self-management tools (eg self-tests ). {p.18}~ The FOPH supports the actors of primary care medicine in early intervention and the treatment of addictions by preparing the knowledge required for this purpose and making them available to them. {p.19}~ Knowledge transfer: knowledge acquired through monitoring and research is analyzed and made available to all stakeholders through congresses, publication of information on the Internet or e-mails {p.32}~ Promotion of practical tools: the FOPH supports efforts to continue to disseminate, in particular through awareness-raising among training institutions, the tools and methods available for dealing with addiction issues. For example, the FOPH supports the dissemination of the method of ""motivational interviewing"", which helps to stimulate behavior change in order to better manage his own health. {p.33}~ The prevention of health risks through information is one of the main tasks of cantonal and national health authorities. The FOPH continues to support cantons and addiction associations in their efforts to raise public awareness of addiction problems and publish information on its website. {p.34}~ Professionals and the public are actively informed about addiction issues and general health conditions. Risk factors are highlighted {p.35}~ ",N,,"Creation and development of an addiction monitoring system {p.11}~ Drug Market Analysis and Progress Reporting {p.11}~ regulating markets for psychoactive substances {p.22}~ the FOPH creates the necessary conditions for the cantons, municipalities and other executive bodies to exchange experiences on the implementation of legal provisions related to the issue of addictions. {p.23}~ Establishment of the list of narcotic drugs: exchanges between health and customs authorities are intensified regarding the preparation of the list of illegal substances and the seizure of narcotic drugs {p.24}~ in cooperation with the cantonal police forces and other actors, fedpol monitors developments in the drug markets, in particular developments in the field of drug trafficking. {p.32}~ fedpol contributes to the implementation of the National Strategy Addictions essentially in two ways: by following the evolution of the situation on the markets for narcotic drugs, and by exchanging it with the other actors concerned, in particular with federal authorities as The FOPH and the AFD. {p.32}~",N,,"Representation of Switzerland's interests and exchange of experience and knowledge at the international level {p.11}~ the FOPH sets up a monitoring system using existing data sources (eg the Swiss Health Survey, police crime statistics, hospital medical statistics or wastewater analysis) (Eg Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey or the act-info treatment statistic). In doing so, it ensures compliance with international standards so that this system is most compatible with international surveys such as the European Drugs Report. {p.32}~ Switzerland actively participates in international efforts to strengthen public health and privileges the international exchange of experience and knowledge. The Swiss foreign policy on health, which is the instrument guaranteeing coordination between the health policy, external policy and development cooperation policy objectives, is an important guide for its implementation. {p.37}~ Switzerland defends its interests and the objectives of the National Strategy Addictions in intergovernmental organizations or organizations (UN, WHO, UNODC, EU, Council of Europe, OECD). This includes both legally binding conventions (in the areas of illegal drugs and tobacco) and its collaboration with international strategies, action plans and the follow-up committees, and recommendations emanating from them (particularly in the fields of narcotics, Alcohol and tobacco). {p.37}~ on request or on its own initiative, the FOPH organizes and maintains bilateral and multilateral contacts on the policy of addictions with governmental representations and foreign delegations. {p.37}~ Switzerland actively participates in the work of international bodies or working groups which play an important role in the exchange of experience and knowledge.

Such an approach will also reduce the increased risk of substance misuse in this group. {p.7} ~ Substitute prescribing continues to have a role to play in the treatment of heroin dependence, both in stabilising drug use and supporting detoxification. Medically-assisted recovery can, and does, happen.

It is also about ensuring that they have somewhere to live, something to do and the ability to form positive relationships. {p.22} ~  It is therefore vital that communities recognise the importance of providing accommodation for these people. {p.23} ~  We want to continue to work with the homelessness sector and other local providers to facilitate better joint working with drug treatment organisations and promote good practice {p.23} ~ The Government will also work with the sector and local authorities and communities to examine the development of a Payment by Results process to develop local accountability and transparency for housing- related support services, for people dependent on drugs and/or alcohol. {p.23} ~  Our aim is to increase the number of drug and alcohol dependent benefit claimants who successfully engage with treatment and rehabilitation services and ultimately find employment, which is a key contributor to a sustained recovery {p.23} ~",estimated prevalence of heroin or crack cocaine users that are on benefits {p.23} ~,," In pregnancy, midwives can play a key role in identifying those dependent on drugs or alcohol at a time when they are likely to be more willing to accept help and do the best for their unborn child. {p.22} ~ ",N,,"Reducing demand – creating an environment where the vast majority of people who have never taken drugs continue to resist any pressures to do so, and making it easier for those that do to stop. This is key to reducing the huge societal costs, particularly the lost ambition and potential of young drug users. The UK demand for illicit drugs is contributing directly to bloodshed, corruption and instability in source and transit countries, which we have a shared international responsibility to tackle {p.3} ~ Building recovery in communities - this Government will work with people who want to take the necessary steps to tackle their dependency on drugs and alcohol, and will offer a route out of dependence by putting the goal of recovery at the heart of all that we do. We will build on the huge investment that has been made in treatment to ensure more people are tackling their dependency and recovering fully. {p.4} ~ Reduce illicit and other harmful drug use {p.4} ~ Increase the numbers recovering from their dependence. {p.4} ~ It is important that young people’s services are configured and resourced to respond to these particular needs and to offer the right support as early as possible {p.8} ~  We will establish a whole-life approach to preventing and reducing the demand for drugs that will: • break inter-generational paths to dependency by supporting vulnerable families; • provide good quality education and advice so that young people and their parents are provided with credible information to actively resist substance misuse; • use the creation of Public Health England (PHE) to encourage individuals to take responsibility for their own health; • intervene early with young people and young adults; • consistently enforce effective criminal sanctions to deter drug use; and • support people to recover, as set out below in the section ‘Building recovery in communities’. {p.9} ~ The Healthy Child Programme for example, is based on the evidence of what is needed to support children’s health and development, beginning at the pregnancy stage. This will play a key role including providing regular reviews, parenting support and health promotion guidance. To make sure we are able to offer this programme to every family with a young child, as well as giving extra help for those who need it, we will recruit an additional 4,200 health visitors by 2015. {p.9} ~ Families, particularly those with the most complex needs, will be supported to give their children the best possible start in life. From 2012-13, all disadvantaged two year olds will receive 15 hours per week of early years education and care and we will continue to make the same support available to all three and four year olds. Sure Start will be refocused on its original purpose of improving the life chances of disadvantaged children, with funding maintained in cash terms. {p.9} ~ Family Nurse Partnerships will develop the parental capacity of mothers and fathers within potentially vulnerable families, through intensive and structured support from early on in the pregnancy until the child is two years old {p.9} ~ Schools have a clear role to play in preventing drug and alcohol misuse as part of their pastoral responsibilities to pupils. We will make sure school staff have the information, advice and the power to: • Provide accurate information on drugs and alcohol through drug education and targeted information via the FRANK service; • Tackle problem behaviour in schools, with wider powers of search and confiscation. We will make it easier for head teachers to take action against pupils who are found to be dealing drugs in school; and • Work with local voluntary organisations, the police and others to prevent drug or alcohol misuse. {p.10} ~ Early intervention foryoung people and families {p.11} ~ For those young people whose drug or alcohol misuse has already started to cause harm, or who are at risk of becoming dependent, they will have rapid access to specialist support that tackles their drug and alcohol misuse alongside any wider issues that they face. Substance misuse services, youth offending, mental health and children’s services must all work together to ensure this support is in place {p.11} ~ The focus for all activity with young drug or alcohol misusers should be preventing the escalation of use and harm, including stopping young people from becoming drug or alcohol dependent adults. Drug and alcohol interventions need to respond incrementally to the risks in terms of drug use, vulnerability and, particularly, age. {p.12} ~ For those very few young people who develop dependency, the aim is to become drug or alcohol free. This requires structured treatment with the objective of achieving abstinence, supported by specialist young people’s services such as Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).  {p.12} ~ In relation to drug dependence and offending, the sentencing framework must support courts to identify options, other than prison, which will help an offender tackle their drug or alcohol dependence, whilst recognising that, for some offenders, custody is necessary. Drug Rehabilitation Requirements (DRR) offer the courts - through offender management, treatment and testing – a robust option in the community for tackling the drug misuse and offending of many of the most problematic adult offenders. {p.12} ~  In addition, we will encourage those dependent on drugs or alcohol into recovery-focused services in the community by: • Developing and evaluating options for providing alternative forms of treatment-based accommodation in the community; • Making liaison and diversion services available in police custody suites and at courts by 2014; and • Diverting vulnerable young people away from the youth justice system where appropriate. Point of Arrest diversion schemes are currently testing effective diversion for young people with complex needs. {p.12} ~ Integrated Offender Management (IOM) brings together the police, probation service, youth offending teams, local authorities and voluntary and community groups. Together they identify, support and manage priority offenders, including drug misusing offenders, and divert them away from drug use and crime. {p.15} ~ Our ultimate goal is to enable individuals to become free from their dependence; something we know is the aim of the vast majority of people entering drug treatment. Supporting people to live a drug-free life is at the heart of our recovery ambition. {p.18} ~ Freedom from dependence on drugs or alcohol {p.20} ~ Active promotion and support of local mutual aid networks such as Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous will be essential. We will also support communities to build networks of ‘Recovery Champions’ who will spread the message that recovery is worth aspiring to and help those starting their journey. {p.21} ~ We envisage local areas establishing ‘Recovery Champions’ at three levels: i) Strategic recovery champions – leaders such as Drug and Alcohol Commissioners and Directors of Public Health who promote the recovery orientated system; ii) Therapeutic recovery champions – those delivering services who are successful early adopters of a recovery approach; and iii) Community recovery champions – people who are already in recovery, who will be encouraged to mentor and support their peers and contribute to prevention in communities and schools {p.21} ~ Playing a more positive role in their child’s upbringing is often a motivating factor for individuals in making a full recovery. Parents are the single most important factor in a child’s wellbeing and therefore it is critical that children and adult services are provided, which in some cases will enable the child to remain living safely within their family whilst their parent’s substance misuse is being addressed. {p.22} ~ The first step is to ensure that the benefit system supports engagement with recovery services. We will offer claimants who are dependent on drugs or alcohol a choice between rigorous enforcement of the normal conditions and sanctions where they are not engaged in structured recovery activity, or appropriately tailored conditionality for those that are. Over the longer term, we will explore building appropriate incentives into the universal credit system to encourage and reward treatment take-up. {p.23} ~ We will also look at amending legislation to make it clear that where someone is attending residential rehabilitation and would be eligible for out-of-work benefits, they will be deemed to have a reduced capability for employment and will therefore be automatically entitled to Employment Support Allowance {p.23} ~ Employment programmes need to be closely integrated with treatment and focus on building up skills and self esteem. {p.24} ~","Estimates of number of illicit drug users (Ever taken; Last year; Past month),16-59 year olds, by Class A type drugs (Cocaine (powder cocaine, Crack cocaine); Ecstasy; Hallucinogens (LSD, Magic Mushrooms); Opiates (Heroin, Methadone)) {p.5} ~ Estimates of number of illicit drug users (Ever taken; Last year; Past month),16-59 year olds, by Class A/B type drugs (Amphetamines: Amphetamines, Methamphetamines)  {p.5} ~ Estimates of number of illicit drug users (Ever taken; Last year; Past month),16-59 year olds, by Class B type drugs (Cannabis) {p.5} ~ Estimates of number of illicit drug users (Ever taken; Last year; Past month),16-59 year olds, by Class B/C type drugs (Tranquilisers) {p.5} ~ Estimates of number of illicit drug users (Ever taken; Last year; Past month),16-59 year olds, by Class C type drugs (Anabolic Steroids; Ketamine) {p.5} ~ Estimates of number of illicit drug users (Ever taken; Last year; Past month),16-59 year olds, by Class Not classified type drugs (Amyl Nitrate, Glues) {p.5} ~ number of hospital admissions linked to young people’s drinking each year {p.6} ~ number of heroin and/or crack cocaine users that are in treatment in any one year {p.6} ~ number of young people who access specialist support for substance misuse {p.8} ~",,"Restricting supply - drugs cost the UK £15.4 billion each year.

This includes placing a greater emphasis on building resilience and confidence among our young people to prevent the range of risks they face (e.g. drug and alcohol misuse, crime, exploitation, unhealthy relationships). {p.6} ~ We will raise our ambition for full recovery by improving both treatment quality and outcomes for different user groups; ensuring the right interventions are given to people according to their needs; and facilitating the delivery of an enhanced joined-up approach to commissioning and the wide range of services that are essential to supporting every individual to live a life free from drugs. {p.7} ~ PHE will support local areas to take action to improve health and wellbeing across the lifecourse, including: • providing professional guidance for midwives, health visitors and school nurses under the Healthy Child Programme; • providing support and guidance to local authorities, including systems to support integrated commissioning and service delivery, from conception to the age of five; providing support to school nurses, teachers and wider community services including youth workers to work together to promote health and wellbeing; and • providing information and intelligence to improve decision-making, enabling high quality and cost effective services, through the National Child and Maternal Health Intelligence Network, including child health profiles {p.8} ~ We will encourage schools and teachers and school nurses to develop their practice with the support of specialist organisations and expert professionals. {p.9} ~ We will encourage the use of prevention strategies at primary and secondary school, such as the ‘Get Set for the Spirit of Sport’ campaign, to provide teachers with resources to encourage young people to develop a core set of values that enables them to make the right decisions in and out of sport, including avoiding substance misuse.  {p.9} ~ develop our Talk to FRANK service so that it remains a trusted and credible source of information and advice for young people and (concerned) others {p.9} ~ expand the Alcohol and Drugs Education and Prevention Information Service (ADEPIS) to reach wider prevention partners e.g. youth offending teams {p.9} ~ continue to update our New Psychoactive Substances Resource Pack for educators {p.9} ~ continue to develop and promote the ‘Rise Above’ digital hub, that uses interactive and engaging content to delay and prevent young people from engaging in exploratory behaviours (smoking, drinking alcohol, substance misuse and risky sexual practices). By tackling multiple behaviours, it aims to build and improve the all-round resilience of young people so they are able to avoid risky behaviours {p.9} ~ monitor existing programmes, both here and overseas, to share the evidence and to identify future initiatives to help prevent substance misuse and crime, for example the two year trial of the Good Behaviour Game initiative, being run by Mentor UK {p.9} ~ promote the European Drug Prevention Quality Standards (EDPQS) principles to help partners develop and assess the quality of drug prevention initiatives. {p.9} ~  support for Youth Offending Teams to work with individuals from the youth justice system with substance misuse problems and engage them in educational support, particularly those with special educational needs under the new special educational needs and disability reforms, ensuring that Education and Health Care Plans (drawn up by Local Authorities and Clinical Commissioning Groups following assessment) are made where assessed as appropriate to provide relevant and structured support and treatment interventions {p.11} ~ building on the Care Leavers Strategy to ensure that vulnerable care leavers are supported to avoid a range of negative health outcomes, including substance misuse, in particular through the Children and Social Work Act 2017 which ntroduced a new duty on local authorities to extend support from a Personal Adviser to all care leavers to age 25 {p.11} ~ working with Ofsted to ensure those working in services inspected and regulated including children’s homes, independent fostering agencies and residential schools have access to up to-date resources and take appropriate action to tackle substance misuse in the children they care for {p.11} ~ PHE’s review of key components of young people’s specialist substance misuse services which will assist local authorities to commission effective treatment services for young people {p.11} ~ PHE will also work with Family Drug and Alcohol Courts and local public health teams to help them to work together to improve outcomes for families and children. {p.12} ~ PHE will review the evidence and provide advice on the estimated number of children likely to be affected by the drug and/or alcohol use of their parents, and provide advice to national and local government on where action could have the greatest impact on improving children’s outcomes. {p.12} ~ The ACMD is currently looking at the evidence that exists around problems for ageing drug users (aged over 45 years). A Working Group has been established to map the numbers of older drug users in the UK and draw on UK and international evidence to establish the current and future needs of this cohort. We will give full consideration to the findings and recommendations from the ACMD once received. {p.14} ~ We will continue to support local authorities and clinical commissioning groups so that people dependent on medicines can access suitable treatment {p.15} ~ We will continue to encourage wider use of drug testing on arrest to support police forces in monitoring new patterns around drugs and crime and provide an early opportunity to refer offenders into treatment. In addition, we will push for drug testing to be more consistently available in the community so that it can be readily used as part of a community or suspended sentence, removing the incentive to impose a custodial sentence due to uncertainty of provision in the community. {p.23} ~ Our ambition over the period of this Strategy is to build on and expand the existing service to ensure fuller integration with community mental health and substance misuse provision to provide interventions for those who are subject to a criminal justice sanction, particularly for out of court disposals, community orders and suspended sentences. {p.23} ~ We are developing a protocol for drug rehabilitation and other treatment requirements.

This will include new maximum waiting times from the date of sentence. {p.24} ~ enhance our drug testing regime, supporting governors to enable a more extensive drug testing programme, increasing the frequency and range of drugs tested for. This will better inform substance misuse treatment needs, making drug treatment more effective. It will reduce the health harms to prisoners and ensure better continuity of treatment on release into the community. It will also inform assessments of prisons’ performance {p.25} ~  Existing measures that we will reassess include: the role of prison officers. The introduction of a new approach to supporting offenders presents an opportunity for prison officers to play a bigger role in the provision of services, whilst building more constructive and

It is not a statement of government policy: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http:/www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/strategy/assets/drugs_report.pdf. Results show 1) All drugs have an adverse impact; but heroin and crack are by far the most addictive, expensive and harmful drugs. 2) Heroin and/or crack users cause harm to the health and social functioning of users and society as a whole, but users also commit substantial amounts of crime to fund their drug use (costing £16bn a year). Including health and social functioning harms, the harms arising from drug use amount to £24bn a year. 3) There are an estimated 280,000 heroin and/or crack users: at any one time, only 20% of high harm causing users are receiving treatment, whilst 80% are not. 4) Over the course of a year, two thirds of high harm causing users engage with either treatment or criminal justice, but: i) those engaging with treatment tend not to stay with it for long. ii) many of those engaging with criminal justice are not formally identified as users or do not have their use dealt with. iii) a third of high harm causing users do not engage with either treatment or the criminal justice system. 5) The drugs supply business is large, highly flexible and very adaptable; over time the industry has seen consumption grow and prices reduce. 6) Interventions at every stage of the production, trafficking, wholesaling and dealing process have resulted overall in modest seizure rates of up to ~20% of total production. 7) Even if supply-side interventions were more effective, it is not clear that the impact on the harms caused by serious drug users would be reduced ",,

The ‘Transforming Rehabilitation – A Strategy for Reform’ consultation response (published 9 May 2013) set out plans to change the way we manage and rehabilitate offenders in the community, opening up rehabilitative services to a wide range of new providers in the private and voluntary sectors who will bring their creativity and innovation and be paid by results to drive down reoffending. From Autumn 2014, subject to Parliamentary approval, changes to post-release licence arrangements for adults will mean that they can be tested for specified Class A and B drugs. These offenders can be required to attend drug treatment appointments – both measures that increase the ‘grip’ on these prisoners. Crucially, this will be part of additional support that includes tackling offenders’ broader life management issues, and connecting offenders to mental health, and drug and alcohol treatment programmes {p.20} ~ support the existing recovery marches movement to highlight our ambitions and recognise and reward success in overcoming addiction {p.21} ~ continue to facilitate an independent evaluation of the Drug Recovery Wing pilots, which aim to assess whether and how this approach can successfully support the sustained recovery of prisoners and their rehabilitation {p.21} ~ ",N,,"tackle drug dealing on our streets; strengthening the border; and combating the international flow of drugs to the UK to disrupt drug trafficking upstream {p.9} ~ develop a robust approach to stop criminals profiting from the supply of drug cutting agents without penalising legitimate trade, working with production countries, the chemical industry and international partners {p.17} ~ assess the effectiveness of drug trace technology and the outcomes of Drug Free Wing pilots. Alongside efforts to reduce demand for drugs amongst prisoners, tackling the availability of drugs in prisons will help support safer prison environments and will support our efforts to rehabilitate offenders and reduce reoffending {p.17} ~ in relation to new psychoactive substances: [...] - continue to work with law enforcement partners to disrupt the sale of NPS in local head shops and online availability; − continue to monitor NPS as they appear on the market through UK and international early warning systems; work with the ACMD in assessing the risk posed by such substances; and where necessary, invoking temporary bans or permanent controls, including a regular review of generic definitions used in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971; − build on the work of the International Comparative Study, looking at how the UK’s legislative response can be enhanced beyond the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 to tackle such substances. {p.17} ~",N,,"building strong partnerships with international partners to ensure our approach to restricting the supply of drugs is comprehensive, strong and global. We utilise our diplomatic and enforcement assets (including NCA) to build capacity, share expertise, information and intelligence, raise policing, enforce criminal justice and law enforcement standards, and promote best practice in tackling the drugs trade. Such cooperation has led to the arrest of high profile drugs traffickers, the dismantling of organised crime networks, the seizure of many tonnes of drugs and the confiscation of assets of traffickers {p.16} ~ pursuing our drugs objectives within multilateral bodies, including the UN and the EU. In particular, we have made real progress in bolstering the international response to new psychoactive substances: − At the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs in March, we led a resolution that will lead to the development of a global early warning system, enabling monitoring of such substances at a global level for the first time. The resolution received comprehensive international support, with 41 co-sponsors from across every UN region. − As part of its Presidency of the G8, the Government hosted attendees from G8 countries and partners from Poland, Sweden, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, and European Union Commission for two G8 Expert Group meetings on “New Psychoactive Substances: Responding to the challenges”. The outcome of the first meeting was the agreed Statement of Intent which articulates a shared will to cement international information sharing and cooperation; and an intention to identify concrete avenues for further collaboration in specific areas. {p.16} ~ in relation to new psychoactive substances: − take forward work, progressed through our Presidency of the G8, to bolster the global response to NPS, particularly in relation to reinvigoration of the existing international control process; − continue to monitor NPS as they appear on the market through UK and international early warning systems {p.17} ~",N,,N,,,,Not available,Not available,"2,619,000,000,000 USD (2016)",,,The metrics are the same as the ones outlined in the Drug Strategy 2010 Evaluation Framework – evaluating costs and benefits ,

Medical use of narcotics is indispensable and desirable, and it is essential to ensure availability thereof for medical use and to promote scientific research for the generation and validation of new medicinal treatments and products. {p.52} ~  Guarantee accessibility, availability and use of monitored substances for medical and scientific purposes {p.53} ~",N,,"On the other hand, citizen security is focused on individuals’ rights, protection against violence and injury remedying processes. {p.48} ~ Firstly, the aim is to achieve rationality, from a comprehensive and balanced approach, of police policies regarding prevention, police investigation, repression and preventive detention, while strictly adhering to human rights regulations and seeking that interdiction efforts focus on large drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and organized crime groups. For this purpose, the government’s actions need to be coordinated towards a strengthening of democratic institutions, prevention and penalization of corruption and organized crime in terms of illicit drug trafficking, money laundering and related crimes. Specifically, adopt stronger measures to combat the link between drug crimes and human trafficking, sexual exploitation, arms trafficking and different forms of violence against socially vulnerable individuals. {p.49} ~ To update drug regulations and strengthen their application to the interdiction of [...] drug-related crimes by competent agencies, on the basis of respect and protection of human rights, democratic institutions, attachment to justice and proportionality between penalties and criminal offences. {p.49} ~ Reinforce measures for prevention and penalization of corrupt practices among public officers, particularly, police authorities and personnel. {p.50} ~ Strengthen policies for prevention, interdiction and repression of [...] drug-related crimes, particularly, organized crime, whitecollar crime, [...] and human trafficking. {p.50} ~",N,,"Strengthen and broaden social inclusion policies aimed at a reduction of vulnerabilities associated with problematic drug use, by guaranteeing access to universal social protection policies and specific education, culture, housing, health and work programs, in synergy with the National Network on Drugs (Red Nacional de Drogas) and other government and social actors. {p.45} ~ ",N,,"Promote communication strategies proposing a comprehensive, coherent and balanced view of drug policies, from a human rights perspective. {p.43} ~ Drug policies are sustained on the principles of human rights, gender and citizenship. Integration of a human rights approach is based on principles of universality and non-discrimination, indivisibility, participation and account rendering. This requires comprehensive actions aimed at achieving coordinated and equitable access to health, education, justice and social integration, in a manner that seeks to overcome the disadvantages of groups whose rights have been jeopardized. Particularly, by specifically addressing the situation of women, persons deprived of their liberty, migrants and border area populations {p.43} ~ Moreover, practices under national and international human rights regulations must be implemented in connection with interdiction, detention, access to justice and treatment of persons deprived of their liberty. {p.43} ~ Gender-neutral policies tend to replicate and deepen social inequalities originated in an androcentric culture. In this sense, it is necessary to evidence the specific implications that the drug problem -in its multiple dimensions- has on men, women and other gender identities. This requires implementation of actions able to suppress the specific difficulties faced by women to access, join and remain in drug rehabilitation schemes and facilities. Specific actions preventing violence suffered by women in communities where illicit trafficking networks are established and which, specifically, minimize and tend to eliminate the impact of crimes relating to this trafficking, forceful involvement in criminal acts, sexual exploitation and human trafficking are required. Additionally, social development and rights protection alternatives that contribute to improve living conditions are also of  aramount importance {p.44} ~ Social inclusion policies are aimed at persons involved in problematic drug use, including both persons who have begun rehabilitation as well as persons who face difficulty in keeping up with rehabilitation, or who have no access to rehabilitation schemes, treatment centers or other social benefi ts. A personal rights approach deeply rooted in social bonds will be maintained and reinforced, strengthening the ability to create autonomy and liberty and to build citizenship. {p.44} ~ To promote social equity through the effective incorporation of an approach based on human rights, gender, social integration and active participation of citizens. {p.44} ~ Ensure effective incorporation of human rights to the national drug policy framework. {p.45} ~ Further develop mainstreaming of the gender perspective throughout the drug policy approach, as well as throughout all plans, programs and actions carried out by the different entities within the National Drug Control Board, and promote mainstreaming of the gender perspective among other actors. {p.45} ~ Strengthen and broaden social inclusion policies aimed at a reduction of vulnerabilities associated with problematic drug use, by guaranteeing access to universal social protection policies and specific education, culture, housing, health and work programs, in synergy with the National Network on Drugs (Red Nacional de Drogas) and other government and social actors. {p.45} ~ Promote dialog and participation by the community throughout the whole cycle of public policies on drugs. {p.45} ~ At the same time, it is necessary to enhance the development of specific comprehensive care schemes for critical cases, low-demand cases, and women and persons deprived of their liberty. {p.46} ~ Another goal is to strengthen continuous support throughout the process as well as continuous follow-up upon discharge; mechanisms for guaranteeing respect for ethical principles and human rights; awareness, training and communication that promote destigmatization from a human rights perspective, aimed at healthcare system staff, drug users and the community. {p.47} ~ Consolidate the National Network for Drug Care and Treatment, both governmentand private-sector managed, ensuring universal coverage, accessibility and inter-agency coordination among the different services, as well as strengthening and broadening existing schemes, from protection and low-demand to highly specialized schemes, while relying on specifi c initiatives for women and women with children, persons deprived of their liberty and, generally, people under the justice system. {p.48} ~ Under this approach (justice and coexistence), policies are aimed at de-constructing stereotypes and socially stigmatizing representations, favoring tolerance and contributing to the development of skills for conflict resolution. {p.48} ~ Secondly, the goal is to favor actions that guarantee access to drug care and treatment, social inclusion, respect of human rights of prosecuted individuals and persons deprived of their liberty and the application of alternatives to imprisonment. {p.49} ~ Incorporate, in the different interventions within the framework of the Justice System (broadly conceived), the perspective of coexistence and tolerance, seeking to reduce criminalization and stigmatization of individuals related in different ways to drugs. {p.49} ~ Promote changes in drug regulations, ensuring the integration of a human rights approach and the review of crimes and applicable penalties {p.49} ~ Promote alternatives to imprisonment and early release schemes, through the development of plans and programs for socio-labor and educational integration targeted to highly vulnerable populations involved in drug trafficking, particularly, women involved in micro-trafficking. {p.50} ~ ",N,,"The Strategy aims at the development of a comprehensive prevention system that coordinates the joint effort of different initiatives by several actors involved in education, labor, family and community  environments, as well as initiatives addressed to the problematic use of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs. Promotion of a healthy life through strategies for the development of psychosocial skills and competences, and risk management, is considered. {p.45} ~ Develop a preventive comprehensive system that contemplates actions for the promotion of health and prevention of problematic drug use, through strategies for the development of psychosocial skills and capabilities as well as risk management strategies, targeted to the educational, labor, family and community environments, in conjunction with key actors, with an emphasis on vulnerable populations. {p.47} ~ Implement prevention programs, information and awareness campaigns on problematic use of cannabis in educational and labor areas, driving, and cannabis use among registered cannabis users under the applicable regulations. {p.47} ~ Strengthen leadership throughout the whole drug care and treatment system, in compliance with regulatory aspects. Improve mechanisms for monitoring and controlling the drug care and treatment system. {p.47} ~ Promote strategies for the reduction of risks and damages aimed at all drug users, by implementing educational, preventive, care, treatment and social inclusion proposals in the educational, labor and community areas, empowering individuals in the exercise of their rights and obligations. {p.48} ~ Secondly, the goal is to favor actions that guarantee access to drug care and treatment, social inclusion, respect of human rights of prosecuted individuals and persons deprived of their liberty and the application of alternatives to imprisonment. {p.49} ~ Reinforce prevention, control and transparency mechanisms in police intervention, with the purpose of ensuring attachment to justice, the respect and protection of human rights (particularly throughout intelligence operations), application of special techniques for investigation, enquiry, preventive detention and precautionary measures. {p.49} ~ ",N,,"To update drug regulations and strengthen their application to the interdiction of illicit trafficking, money laundering [...] by competent agencies, on the basis of respect and protection of human rights, democratic institutions, attachment to justice and proportionality between penalties and criminal offences. {p.49} ~ Strengthen inter-agency coordination towards an improvement of mechanisms  for control, interdiction and penalization of tobacco, alcohol and cannabis smuggling and illicit trafficking. {p.50} ~ Strengthen policies for prevention, interdiction and repression of illicit trafficking of drugs, precursors and chemicals and related crimes, particularly, organized crime, whitecollar crime, money laundering, and arms and human trafficking. {p.50} ~ The Strategy assumes that the drug policy model requires clear intervention from the government regarding control and regulation of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis markets, to ensure that market development does not jeopardize public health and coexistence, and at the same time, minimizes the impact of the illegal market. {p.50} ~ In order to regain the government’s involvement in this area it is necessary, first, to strengthen mechanisms for control and regulation of drugs supply, as well as mechanisms for the prevention of controlled chemical substance diversion and penalization of the illegal drug supply market. This involves protecting the formal market and intervening in the informal and illegal sector, particularly as regards smuggling and illicit traffi cking of drugs, by adopting specific strategies for border areas and international tourism. {p.51} ~ In addition, the Strategy seeks to strengthen agencies that control and regulate the cannabis market, by promoting effi cient implementation of Law No. 19.172 in each of its forms, and a monitoring and assessment system that enables to evidence success and error, generates corrective actions and, particularly, educates ensuring continuous improvement. {p.51} ~ Secondly, the Strategy seeks to continue implementing a process of continuous improvement of policies aimed at preventing, detecting and penalizing money laundering with the purpose of protecting the fi nancial market and deprive traffickers and criminal organizations from the economic benefi ts of this business. Furthermore, the confiscation of assets, products and instruments related to illicit drug trafficking and money laundering is a supplementary policy that has acquired great importance in drug policies worldwide. The actions are aimed at ensuring institutional strength of the Confiscated Assets Fund (Fondo de Bienes Decomisados), as well as at improving asset recovery management and liquidation mechanisms, transparency in asset distribution processes and account rendering processes. {p.51} ~ Thirdly, the synthetic psychoactive drug market and the illicit manufacturing of synthetic psychoactive drugs have proven highly dynamic during the last years, obtaining raw materials for precursors and chemical substances from the legal market. In response to this, the State has sought to strengthen policies aimed at preventing and penalizing the diversion of precursors and chemical substances to the illicit production of drugs, by reinforcing control and surveillance of the legal market in chemical substances controlled by International Conventions on Drugs. {p.52} ~ The purpose is to strengthen DISCO’s capacity to control the local market and international transactions involving controlled substances through an improvement of registration systems and analysis of information on companies, substances and transaction volumes, the strengthening of market agents’ monitoring and inspection capacity, the promotion of public sector- private sector cooperation and the improvement of processes for destroying confi scated precursors and chemical substances. {p.52} ~ Strengthen mechanisms for control and regulation of regulated drug supply, as well as measures for controlling chemical substances and pharmaceutical products markets, as well as the fi nancial market. {p.52} ~ Reinforce mechanisms for controlling and monitoring sale of psychoactive substances within the framework of models for the regulation of alcohol, cannabis and tobacco markets, among others. {p.53} ~ Strengthen control measures for preventing diversion of precursors and chemical substances from the legal market to illegal drug production. {p.53} ~ Strengthen any measures necessary for controlling the pharmaceutical product market, preventing the use thereof for non-medical purposes, as well as for the illegal production of psycho-active substances. {p.53} ~ Strengthen policies for prevention and repression of money laundering including asset investigation as well as seizing and confi scation of assets held by criminal organizations. {p.53} ~ Strengthen the Fund of Confiscated Property for the administration and distribution of seized and confi scated property in cases of illicit drug trafficking and money laundering. {p.53} ~ ",N,,"Provide continuity to national information systems on drugs and to the National Drug Monitoring Initiative (Observatorio Nacional de Drogas), as well as promote scientific research in conjunction with the academic environment and research centers, either public or private, and the community, at both national and international level. {p.43} ~ Strengthen scientific monitoring and assessment mechanisms regarding drug policies, as drivers of substantial evidence for their management and continuous improvement, in conjunction and cooperation with national and international entities working on this issue. {p.43} ~ As regards Uruguay’s relationships at regional and international level, the proposal is to encourage and promote a comprehensive and balanced approach to drug policies, targeted to individuals, communities and, particularly, drug users. We reaffirm the importance of protecting the human rights system, as well as the government’s obligation to guarantee that such system prevails over international legal instruments on drugs {p.53} ~ International policies on drugs will promote a new model focused on individuals and communities, the central components of which will be equity, effective access to enjoyment of rights, sustainable and supportable development, international cooperation and peoples’ self-determination. {p.54} ~ The goal is to support active participation promoting open and continuous dialog, while prioritizing the debate on drug policies in multilateral organizations such as the UN, CICAD/OAS, EU/CELAC, and regional organizations such as UNASUR, MERCOSUR and GRULAC. {p.54} ~ Additionally, the proposal is to continue with participation and promotion of debate within the different agencies forming part of the United Nations System, such as the Human Rights Council, WHO, ONUSIDA, UNODC and ONUMUJERES, as well as others. {p.54} ~ Within this framework, SOUTH-SOUTH cooperation will be specially strengthened, as well as cooperation between policy regional integration efforts involving MERCOSUR and UNASUR. Furthermore, bilateral cooperation will be promoted for specifically addressing the issue of border areas. {p.54} ~ Develop an international policy on drugs that maintains and deepens debate on policies, the central ideas of which are: promotion of equity, improvement of public health, access to justice and social development, strengthening the Rule of Law, governance and execution capacities thereof, effective control over markets and territories, and peacekeeping; as well as international cooperation respecting different approaches and taking into account different realities. {p.55} ~ Stimulate effective integration of human rights within the international framework of drug policies. {p.55} ~ Continue promoting debate on and review of policies in order to effectively face the world drug problem. {p.55} ~ Support the country’s active participation in different multilateral and regional cooperation instances and organizations in order to strengthen international cooperation. {p.55} ~ Develop legal cooperation, technical and operating international assistance on drugs. {p.55} ~ Foster bilateral cooperation to generate actions in border areas. {p.55} ~ Promote and enhance international agreements, programs and projects. {p.55} ~ ",N,,"Institutionally strengthen the National Drug Control Board’s leadership regarding effective coordination and implementation of drug policies, based on the development of a strategy of decentralization, communication, education and training, generation of scientific evidence and planning, continuous monitoring and assessment. {p.42} ~ Strengthen the National Drug Control Board’s leadership regarding drug policies. {p.42} ~ Further develop decentralization and territorialization of drug policies promoting Drug Control Boards acting at Department and local level (JDD and JLD), and government commitment, fostering community participation in the design, execution and monitoring of actions. {p.42} ~ Continue to develop training programs, systematic refl ection and generation of scientific knowledge regarding drug policies and how to approach the drug problem {p.43} ~ Provide continuity to national information systems on drugs and to the National Drug Monitoring Initiative (Observatorio Nacional de Drogas), as well as promote scientific research in conjunction with the academic environment and research centers, either public or private, and the community, at both national and international level. {p.43} ~ Strengthen scientific monitoring and assessment mechanisms regarding drug policies, as drivers of substantial evidence for their management and continuous improvement, in conjunction and cooperation with national and international entities working on this issue. {p.43} ~ Define mechanisms for consultation, advice and cooperation in the implementation of drug policies, with the Judiciary, the Attorney General Office, and academic entities or other organizations related to the Justice System, particularly, in training and information system issues. {p.50} ~",,,,Not available,Not available,"52,420,000,000 USD",,,"""A focus on the drug issue is adopted as a matter of human rights, citizenship, public health and social integration focused on individuals and communities."" {p.14} ~ An external evaluation of the 20115-2015 drug policy was conducted by the university, please see the following website for more information: http://www.infodrogas.gub.uy/images/stories/pdf/END_2011_2015.pdf  ",
