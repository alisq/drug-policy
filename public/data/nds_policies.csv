The farmers‟ associations are to better represent their interests, to provide access to credit (together with Agriculture Development Fund, and to play a role in development of markets, seeds and livestock. Also support the establishment of women‟s associations and resource centres {p.37} ~ Build strategic reserves for grain through local procurement which would improve food security and provide incentives for the farmer to grow wheat and other commodities and supply it to MAIL based on contract. {p.37} ~ Encouraging import substitution where Afghanistan can competitively produce food products currently being supplied from elsewhere. This would include procurement of wheat by WFP and emergency supplies by OCHA, UNHCR and other UN agencies and procurement of general nature by ISAF/NATO {p.37} ~ Focusing especially on high-value crop horticultural crops that can offer farmers returns comparable with the expected risk-adjusted returns from poppy cultivation {p.37} ~ Reintroduction of industrial crops such as cotton, sugar beets, oilseed crops on a vast scale in the northern plains and southern plains. As cotton and sugar beets require a lot of water, they can re-introduced along the southern loop of Helmand River Basin and along the Kunduz River where the water could be used for the dual purpose of paddy rice and sugar beets. {p.37} ~ Sustainable and environmentally-sound utilization of medicinal plants such as licorice, heng, artemesia and carabia {p.37} ~ Improving land tenure security in order to improve the chances for licit crop production and to allow farmers to justify longer-term investments in new production {p.37} ~ Establishment of food security plans, reforestation, rejuvenation of natural pastures and rangeland and equitable use of these resources (forestry, pastures, water etc). {p.37} ~ In the NRM Sector: Water Resources Development: Creation of employment through building water harvesting structures (by the thousands); Watershed management systems (for each River System in the country); Reforestation; Pasture and rangeland renovation {p.38} ~ In the Extractive Industries: Investments in the mining sector; Investments in the gas and petroleum exploration, extraction and refining {p.38} ~ In the Manufacturing Sector In the Construction and Public Infrastructure Sector: In order to create millions of jobs, there is a need for another policy and conducive legal framework to promote industrial development through public and private sectors, at public works (i.e. construction of railways) and in the mining sector; Vocational training is necessary to provide the skills needed in other sectors such as in the extractive industries, construction, agriculture and so on. Interventions by the HRD Cluster under NPP1 on Vocational Skill Training will pave the way for training of 150,000 unemployed, under-employed and illiterate population for the objective of preparing them for the labor market. {p.38} ~ Meeting the objectives of this Policy requires the creation of sustainable job opportunities, and the private sector will be the major source of those opportunities, in agro-enterprise and other sectors {p.38} ~ Lack of access to sustainable source of water for Irrigation is one of the key reasons why farmers resort to poppy cultivation. Thus, there is a definite need for improved and efficient irrigation systems and introduction of drought-adapted crops to conserve water. {p.39} ~ Access to safe and sustainable source of drinking water and infrastructure for water distribution in rural communities. {p.39} ~ Electricity for alternative production, for example processing of agricultural products, cold storage, value chain development and other industries {p.39} ~ Access to markets, such as transport links for food products that need to reach consumers in good condition {p.39} ~ Sustainable sources of energy at district and sub-district level is of paramount importance for value chain development. {p.40} ~ Ensuring reliable, sustainable and low-cost energy supplies for private sector development through rural hydro-power stations {p.40} ~ Electricity for alternative production, for example processing and packaging of agricultural products, cold storage, value chain development, local manufacturing and other industries. {p.40} ~ Many components of agricultural value chain are missing and have to be developed to add value and hence increase rural incomes. The most critical missing link is cold storage for high-value horticultural crops and dairy products: Infrastructure (i.e., cold storage facilities at the village and district level); Grain storage structures. Post-harvest losses in Afghanistan are estimated at 15% which is significant meaning up to 750,000 MT of grain is lost. If post-harvest losses are cut down, the savings could go a long way for attaining food security in the country; Promotion of fresh/dry high-value horticultural and medicinal crops as “Organic Produce”; Access to domestic and international markets (linking small producers to the market); Introduction and promotion of “Contract Farming” {p.40} ~ The major task of rebuilding the country and searching for alternative livelihoods needs to be guided by comprehensive research, with reliable data subjected to appropriate analysis. The capability of the Government to undertake or commission applied research needs to be strengthened through active and dynamic partnerships with research centres of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)91, such as ICARDA, ICRISAT, CYMMIT, AVRDC and ILRI, as well as reputable research institutes and agricultural universities in India, Iran and Turkey. This research needs to be practically oriented, include socio-economic research and take into account the drivers of poppy cultivation in different part of the country. {p.42} ~ Legal Environment: There is a need to review / develop laws that provide incentives for private sector development. {p.44}  ~ Policy Framework: Should include a policy that consider grants to farmers giving up poppy cultivation, an employment policy promoting afghan-first recruitment in the industry sector, a policy to promote the development of industries (through grants, free land leases) {p.44} ~ Scale up and complete the existing initiatives underway by MRRD and MAIL so that rural communities would have access to a critical mass of support that would allow them to reorganize production systems along market-driven lines and to develop the physical and institutional infrastructures needed to support the shift from subsistence agriculture to commercial activity {p.45} ~ Environmental conservation of natural resources such as water, land, forests, and sustainable utilizations of natural pastures, rangelands and medicinal plants. {p.46} ~","prevalence of the Afghan population live below the poverty line, with per capita incomes of 45 cents per day or less {p.25} ~ prevalence of the population (5.7 million) that are only just above the poverty line and spend the majority of their income on food, indicating a high vulnerability to shocks {p.25} ~ number of communities mobilised {p.41} ~ number of registered CDCs {p.41} ~",,"Enhancing employment and entrepreneurial opportunities for women {p.26} ~ Economic Empowerment of Women as a Cross-Cutting Option: Investments in livestock under NPP-3 and NPP-4 is a first-class entry point for economic empowerment of women and diversification of the household income. High-potential mechanisms to improve value include dairy processing, sheep fattening, cashmere fiber development and skin garments. {p.31} ~ 5 Gender mainstreaming through equitable entrepreneurial opportunities for women under all AL interventions in order to strengthen and diversify licit sources of household income. {p.46} ~",N,,N,number of problem drug users {p.11} ~,,"To maintain the “poppy-free” status (i.e., prevent the resurgence of poppy cultivation) in communities which have consciously opted not to engage in, or have strived to abandon, illicit cultivation and production of narcotics (i.e., through Social Contracts) by addressing the key drivers of opium poppy cultivation {p.9} ~ To prevent the spread of cultivation to areas hitherto unaffected by narcotics by embedding CN measures, realizing the mobility of the narco-entrepreneurs who are ready to exploit vulnerabilities. {p.9} ~ It is important not to lose sight of the poppy-free provinces under this Policy because there are indications that the opium trade can still persist even if there is no cultivation taking place in a particular province (i.e., the outflow of narcotics across the Amu River through the northern provinces and the Afghan-Turkmen borders) and contribute to illicit incomes, impacting security, governance and fostering corruption in the poppy-free provinces {p.15} ~ -Undertaking robust analysis of the drivers of opium poppy production {p.36} ~","To achieve a steady reduction (25 % reduction after 6-years, or 5500 ha/year) of opium poppy cultivation {p.9} ~ production of opium poppy (in MT) in 2009 {p.11} ~ the cultivation of opium poppy in 2011 (in hectares) {p.11} ~ percent of illicit drugs that are intercepted by law enforcement authorities while the unimpeded movement of the drugs, precursor chemicals, money, explosives, weapons and insurgents across the Durand Line and the international borders destabilize the country {p.11} ~ Estimates (in USD) of proceeds from the illegal drug trade falling in the hands of the insurgents and warlords {p.11} ~",,"Advocate Global Support for AL It is well recognized now that the war on drugs can not be fought by GIRoA alone and that countries of the region and the world at large must assist Afghanistan in this global menace. Since a sustainable reduction in opium poppy cultivation can not be achieved without having the key pre-requisite-AL in place, it is imperative that the international community must continue to support GIROA‟s economic development efforts including alternative livelihoods. {p.33} ~ Advocacy at JCMB, Quadrilateral and Trilateral CN Initiatives {p.33} ~ Follow up with Russia on implementation of Rainbow-2 {p.33} ~ All AL partners and international development agencies are to build linkages with MAIL as the Lead Ministry under ARD Cluster and support MAIL during the course of implementation of the NPPs {p.37} ~ Enhance aid effectiveness: GIRoA and international partners to finance NPPs and channel aid flow through the national budget.

[...]  The information centre should not necessarily focus on law enforcement alone as it can also help citizens obtain information on drug treatment information for addicts or even can provide alternative livelihood information for the farmers {p.28} ~ Hold meetings at the district centers between tribal leaders, mullahs, district officials, law enforcement officials, and the Ministry of Counter Narcotics. This will help to build trust among people and will help to some of the underlying problems in the districts that lead to drug dependency. It is important to focus on helping addicts complete treatment; by engaging at the district level, we can identify the root cause and the underlying problem of addiction within the district. {p.29} ~ We should try to ask local communities to get involved and support Afghan government in combating addiction in Afghanistan. {p.35} ~",number of people who use drugs that are between the ages of 15-19 {p.35} ~,,"Improving poppy eradication process {p.14} ~ Implementing current bilateral and multilateral agreements with regional countries {p.14} ~ Creating better coordination for improving security and better border control {p.14} ~ Making trial meetings of major traffickers public in order to effect other drug trafficking networks {p.14} ~ Targeting High Value Drug Traffickers and Destroying their Networks {p.15} ~ The arrest of mid-level traffickers should be one of the priorities of law enforcement officials. {p.17} ~ Local councils (Jirgas) in the villages and districts play an important role in solving the farmers’ problems and will help us rescue the farmers from the influence of drug traffickers during the cultivation season. {p.17} ~ In order to improve social justice, our legal system must be fair and all court judgments must be according to the law without any prejudice. {p.18} ~ Arresting major drug traffickers should be the top priority of law enforcement officials. Regional coordination between the Counter Narcotics Police of Afghanistan and regional police is needed; we need to work together and develop a procedure which will enable us to arrest and prosecute major regional traffickers. {p.19} ~ Disrupting and Destroying Drug Trafficking Networks {p.20} ~ The Ministry of Finance should streamline the process for the sale of vehicles confiscated from drug crimes as soon as the decision of the court is received, the confiscated vehicles should be publicly auctioned. We should have an efficient, timely processed confiscated vehicles system so they do not sit in a parking lot for several years deteriorating and losing their value while awaiting sale. {p.21} ~ Creation of a specific guideline for seizing the drug trafficker’s vehicles, which will include the registration and timely sale of the vehicles after the final decision of the court. {p.21} ~ Creation of specific guidelines for seizing the properties of drug traffickers, including houses, hotels, restaurants and any other immoveable properties. {p.21} ~ Creation of specific guidelines for seizing the drug trafficker’s financial assets, including domestic and foreign currencies. {p.21} ~ Creation of specific guidelines for seizing drug trafficker’s shares on companies and those companies which are directly or indirectly funded by them {p.22} ~ Ministry of Counter Narcotics, in coordination and close co-operation with the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Defense, the National Directorate of Security and Local authorities, should annually draft list of major landowners that are involved in poppy cultivation. The Public Information Department of the Ministry of Counter Narcotics with the coordination of law enforcement officials and relevant departments should travel to provinces where poppy is grown. They should summon major landowners and worn them unless they stop poppy cultivation they will be prosecuted {p.23} ~ Local law enforcement must make sure that those who are summoned they are prosecuted if they continue to ignore official warning. No one should be exempt from this rule and government officials who interfere with the process should also be subject to prosecution. This will help implement the law properly and bring the culture of impunity to an end; everyone must be held accountable under the law. {p.23} ~ The Ministry of Counter Narcotics needs to come up with a comprehensive guideline in order to target major landowners who are involved in poppy cultivation {p.24} ~ Identifying and prosecuting of governmental officials who are involved in Drug trafficking {p.25} ~ In order to prevent corruption and ensure better job performance, all counter narcotics law enforcement officers assets and incomes should be confidentially monitored and recorded. Furthermore, their communications, activities, and affiliations should be randomly monitored. {p.25} ~ If it is established that governmental official are involved in drug trafficking or support drug traffickers, then we should have zero tolerance policy and prosecute them without any hesitation {p.25} ~ Targeting Provinces with Highest Level of Drug Trafficking {p.25} ~ We should include drug trafficking route survey with the UNODC/MCN annual poppy cultivation. Governors should be encouraged to focus on drug trafficking offences within their province as much as they do on poppy cultivation level.. There should be a reward and punishment mechanism for governors that substantially reduce trafficking within their province or ignore the issue. Special attention should be given to border provinces that are poppy free. {p.26} ~ First step- law enforcement officials need to have monthly joint technical meetings, where they plan operations on targets and discuss all the options. Second step- the planned operations should be executed jointly among the law enforcement agencies: Ministry of Defense, National Director of Security, the Border Police and the Counter Narcotics Police. {p.27} ~  In order to combat money laundering we need to identify unlawful money transactions and the sources of revenue before taking any legal steps to seize them {p.27} ~ We need to primarily target Afghanistan’s Hawala system where millions of dollars are transferred overseas without any trace or record. We need to impose a heavier penalty to the money laundering offence through the counter narcotics law. There has to be greater public awareness about the money laundering law and courts should impose the maximum sentence on offenders. {p.28} ~ Targeting street level drug supply  {p.29} ~ Identify and survey the locations where there are open selling and buying of drugs in the streets. {p.29} ~ Strengthen intelligence-gathering capabilities of law enforcement agencies to detect above activities. {p.29} ~ Establish fixed and mobile police CN checkpoints {p.29} ~ Special attention should be paid to small traffickers that are trafficking drugs in order to earn money to live; they should be asked how and who encouraged them to do this dangerous job. Collecting this information will lead us to identify the mid-level sources and other people who are involved in the drug trafficking activities {p.29} ~ In the first step all governmental vehicles should be subject to stop and search procedure because they are often used by traffickers as an easy option to smuggle drugs. Ministry of Counter Narcotics and the Ministry of Interior need to create a government vehicle stop and search procedure and sent it to the cabinet for approval. {p.30} ~ Another method of identifying drug traffickers is to track their written and electronic communications. This technique that has been authorised according to articles 24 to 37 of the counter narcotics and intoxicants law had a positive impact to some degree on convicting drug traffickers. Eavesdropping on telephone and internet communications is an effective way to identify drug traffickers. Electronic surveillance techniques are explicitly authorised in the counter narcotics and intoxicants law, we need to widely use these effective methods. {p.32} ~ Speeding up the arrest and identification procedure of drug traffickers {p.32} ~ Provision of a uniform large, medium and small evidence gathering bags for all law enforcement agencies. {p.33} ~ Creation of a procedure for rapid and safe transfer of major traffickers to CJTF. {p.33} ~ Provision of a standard arrest form for all counter narcotics law enforcement agencies. {p.33} ~ Creation of a register form for all moveable and immoveable assets of arrested drug trafficker. {p.33} ~ Creation of a standard procedure for sampling seized drugs. {p.34} ~ The key task here is that we need to restrict access to all unauthorised individuals from tampering evidence. Also we need to consider how we can safely tag and bag evidence. All documents including arrest form, prosecutor’s integration records and all relevant evidence should be kept safe and secure and no unauthorised individual should have access to them. {p.34} ~ . In the long run to deal with the drug addiction in Afghanistan we need to strengthen the rule of law, deal with supply and improve good governance. {p.35} ~ the law enforcement officials should allocate their valuable resources and manpower to arrest major drug traffickers rather than drug addicts possessing small amounts.  {p.36} ~ Destruction of seized opiates when there is no medical need for them {p.36} ~ Using seized opiates for medical purposes {p.36} ~ We should identify laboratories that are used to produce heroin, especially in the provinces where the level of poppy cultivation is high. The NDS resources should be used to locate and destroy heroin production laboratories in coordination with the CNPA. {p.37} ~ Countering precursors that are imported through legal border entry points {p.37} ~ Countering precursors which are imported through smuggling into the country. {p.2} ~ Destruction of precursors found inside the country. {p.37} ~ Precursors that are seized in the country should either be destroyed through a transparent procedure by law enforcement officials, or be used for legal industrial purposes. We should revise the current method of dumping precursors chemicals into the ground {p.38} ~ Establishing more Border Police check points. {p.40} ~ Equipping the Border Police with heavy weapons such as tanks and helicopters {p.40} ~ Providing operational/off-road vehicles to control individuals infiltrating outside of legal border crossings and modern equipment such as big lights, night vision cameras, search lights, communication devices and professional working dogs in the border areas. {p.40} ~ Providing capacity building training for the Border Police such as border control training, searching the vehicle and passengers and equipment which help us to identify narcotics. {p.40} ~ Identifying and closing the smuggling routes through the borders. {p.40} ~ Creating intelligence information in local residents among the tribes in the border areas. {p.40} ~ The sovereign nation of Afghanistan must play the leading role in preventing drug trafficking activities in the border areas; increased control of the border will help the ANSF, especially Border Police in arresting drug traffickers {p.40} ~ The presence of CN professional police in different borders and customs with good and effective equipment and trained dogs and the standard ways in borders is a vital and important need. {p.41} ~ Increase the size of the Border Police and increase the number of check points. {p.41} ~ Equip the Border Police with heavy weapons like helicopters and tanks. {p.41} ~ Providing operational/off-road vehicles to control individuals infiltrating outside of legal border crossings and modern equipment such as big lights, night vision cameras, search lights, communication devices and professional working dogs in the border areas. {p.41} ~ Providing capacity building training for the Border Police such as border control training, vehicle and passenger search procedures and narcotics identification equipment. {p.41} ~ Identifying and closing the smuggling routes across the borders {p.41} ~ Creating intelligence information in local residents among tribal groups in the border areas. {p.42} ~ The nation of Afghanistan as keeper of their county borders can play an important role in preventing drug trafficking activities in the border areas and will help the national security personal specially Border Police in arresting drug traffickers. {p.42} ~ Therefore, we recommend the establishment of an organized system of police operations in the Ministry of Interior and one of the main features in this system should be rewards and punishments for job performance {p.42} ~ Military forces will help to maintain security, Provincial Reconstruction Teams will help to reconstruct the country, and the neighbouring countries forces will help the law enforcement officials to target drug traffickers and prevent them from trafficking drugs into or out of the country. {p.44} ~ The following should be kept in mind while eradicating the targeting areas: Differentiate governmental and non – governmental lands that are under poppy cultivation; Consider the ethnic balance during eradication and prevent ethnic tensions; Consider whether the targeted areas are covered by alternative livelihood programs; Was there a public awareness campaign before cultivation began in the targeted areas?; Consider the weather and natural disasters like drought and flood; The Ministry of Counter Narcotics should provide the map of the targeted areas with the technical support of UNODC.; A separate target area for each province should be developed with the cooperation of the relevant provincial governor; The target area maps should be coordinated before the public awareness campaign process begins. {p.49} ~ The public awareness campaign and the eradication process should be closely coordinated. Many local factors in the eradication process should be seriously considered. {p.49} ~ For a successful poppy eradication process we must consider the following factors in the procurement and human resources plan: Scheduling a specific time for implementation of the process based upon seasons; Provision of equipment for the eradication process; Assurance of coordination for the relevant officials before and during the eradication process in the capital and provinces; Planning and being prepared for the unexpected; Seeking support of law enforcement organisations well in advance; Using local labour in the eradication process; Seeking funds to support human resource structure in the eradication process; Having trained and professional human resources on the eradication working team. {p.50} ~ Eliminating the name “trafficker” from poppy farmers {p.51} ~ We should consider tougher sentence for major traffickers including the option of executed or imprisoned for life. {p.52} ~ The Counter Narcotics Law should give extra authority to customs employees to interdict suspect transit supplies and seize the identified chemicals (precursors) that are transited to a third country through Afghanistan.  {p.52} ~ Precursor chemicals that are seized in the border or if the producing country is known should be returned back to the producing country {p.52} ~ Neutralising chemicals using technology {p.52} ~ Chemicals should be stored in special tankers, according to international standard. {p.52} ~ It is necessary to add a new article in the Counter Narcotics Law about prepayment paid by traffickers to the farmers to encourage more cultivation. The objective of this article is to relieve farmers of the duty to pay back those loans to the traffickers. {p.53} ~ The purpose of creating a trust fund is to appreciate the hard work of honest and dedicated people within the force and punish those who are simultaneously involved in the government and in drug trafficking. {p.54} ~ Creating a trust fund to encourage good performance, law enforcement forces will take their job seriously, have more motivation, and will take pride in their work. This initiative will help to combat drug trade and corruption in Afghanistan. {p.55} ~ It is necessary to create special cells for drug traffickers. Separation of traffickers from other prisoners will result in  preventing other prisoners from making links with the traffickers. {p.56} ~  For their correction and ethical behaviour, it is necessary to place them in separate cells where they have restricted access to other prisoners. It is essential that prisoners do not learn bad habits from professional hard criminals because it prevents them from share their experiences with others. {p.57} ~ When a drug prisoner (except for murderers) behaves properly during his imprisonment, his behaviour should be appreciated and after passing 70% of his imprisonment, they should appear in front of a parole panel and can be conditionally freed with bail and allowed to spend the rest of his imprisonment outside the prison. {p.58} ~To improve the capacity of CNPA, there should be a number of short and long-term training based on their needs, literacy and English language courses as well as computer training. {p.60} ~ The second subject is capacity building of the Counter Narcotics staff within the Ministry of Defense. They also should conduct short and long term professional training, literacy courses, English language courses, computer training, and short-term trips to countries like Columbia and other countries that have experience in counter narcotics so that they can learn from their experiences, including modern methods to detect and arrest drug traffickers {p.61} ~ Border Police’s counter narcotics division current numbers should increase to at least 1200. The border police counter narcotics specialists should be deployed to all borders and zones across the country and will take an important role in detecting and seizing drugs and arresting traffickers {p.61} ~ The NDS should be provided with English language and computer training courses, modern eavesdropping devices and it should have relationships with intelligence organizations of neighbouring countries and international counter narcotics organizations within the region. These activities will be necessary to build the capacity of this entity.  {p.62} ~ The law enforcement department of Ministry of Counter Narcotics is responsible for coordinating the activities of all CN law enforcement agencies. There is a need to build the capacity of this department and its staff should be increased to 25. This department should be provided with long and short-term professional courses in English language, computer, report writing, report collection and information analysis. {p.62} ~ In order to detect precursors coming into the country it is essential to provide well-equipped laboratories in the major zone customs offices and provide mobile laboratories services in other customs offices across the country. Training brochures about drugs and chemicals must be prepared for the relevant customs staff.","30% reduction in drug trafficking in the first three years of this policy’s implementation {p.14} ~ Increasing drug seizure rate (from currently 0.5-1.5 % to 12% - 25% in five years) {p.14} ~ Taking necessary measures to target high value drug traffickers and increase the current arrest level from 1300 small traffickers to 2000 small, middle and high value traffickers. {p.14} ~ increasing precursors seizure rate 30-50% {p.14} ~ number of major traffickers throughout Afghanistan {p.19} ~ the number in dollars that Criminals launder every day out of Afghanistan to other countries {p.27} ~ number in grams of heroin and opium seized {p.36} ~ % of opium produced in the southern provinces {p.41} ~ 50% decrease in poppy cultivation within next five years clear with well-defined target and success measurement indicators {p.49} ~ number of farmers and their families that are involved in poppy cultivation in Afghanistan. {p.51} ~ number of professional staff dedicated on Counter Narcotics {p.60} ~ number of Border Police forces responsible for Counter Narcotics {p.60} ~ number of staff in the Ministry of Interior’s Counter Narcotics division {p.61} ~",,"In order to improve coordination between the ministry of Interior, Foreign Affairs and Ministry of counter narcotics we need to establish a technical Inter-Ministerial Committee.

More specifically, prevention programs targeting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples that engage local perspectives can best incorporate and address local needs. {p.23} ~ Culturally appropriate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs and services are supported that address prevention programs, the impact of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs on individuals and families, and within their communities. {p.24} ~ Two key themes arising from community consultations are the importance of respecting and supporting Aboriginal community ownership and control of solutions to address AOD use and harms, and adopting a partnership approach based on respect. An effective way to achieve this is by developing and strengthening partnerships across all sectors that engage with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, as well as by ensuring that the latter’s perspectives, needs and participation are incorporated at all stages of any prevention and intervention programs. {p.27} ~ Community leaders and Elders take responsibility and a leading role, in partnership with government, to design, deliver and evaluate alcohol, tobacco and other drugs programs. {p.29} ~","Number of culturally and community‐focused diversionary programs available to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and particularly young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. {p.22, p. 26, p.31, & p.34} ~ Inclusion of cultural competencies within the range of organisations that interact with AOD clients. {p.26, p.31, & p.35} ~",,"to prevent the uptake and/or delay the onset of use of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs; reduce the misuse of alcohol and the use of tobacco and other drugs in the community; reduce the misuse of alcohol and the use of tobacco and other drugs in the community; and support people to recover from dependence and reintegrate with the community. {p.4} ~ Workforce initiatives are developed to enhance the capacity and capability of community‐controlled AOD services. {p.5} ~ Workforce initiatives are developed to enhance the capacity and capability of community‐controlled AOD services. {p.21} ~ For optimal treatment outcomes, a range of treatment options (provided in various settings) aimed at reducing individual demand, including screening and brief interventions, withdrawal management, pharmacotherapies, counselling, social support and ongoing support to reduce relapse rates need to be available. {p.12}","Levels of illicit and licit drug use. {p.5 & p.34} ~ Number of community‐driven and community‐accountable prevention programs, for example alcohol management strategies. {p.31 & p.34} ~ Number of referrals of offenders whose offences are AOD‐related to treatment, for example counselling services or residential rehabilitation diversion programs and culturally appropriate AOD services within prisons {p.26, p.31 & p.35} ~ Provision of after care services {p.26 & p.35} ~ Proportion of AOD and Social and Emotional Wellbeing services delivered by community‐controlled organisations {p.26, p.31, & p.35} ~ Number of through‐care programs in correctional and juvenile detention centres. {p.31 & p.35} ~ Engagement in different types of drug treatment and treatment completion. {p.33} ~ Client satisfaction with treatment {p.33 & p.35} ~ Number of formally accredited AOD services. {p.33 & p.35} ~",,"To prevent, stop, disrupt or otherwise reduce the production and supply of illegal drugs; and control, manage and/or regulate the availability of legal drugs. {p.4} ~ Current and emerging issues associated with AOD use and the criminal justice system are effectively addressed. {p.6} ~ Current and emerging issues associated with AOD use and the criminal justice system are effectively addressed. {p.31} ~ Since Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are more likely to be disadvantaged in terms of known risk factors for offending, justice reinvestment is an important strategy for reducing the number of people that come into contact with the justice and correctional systems. Justice reinvestment recognises the association between incarceration and disadvantage, and the role for the justice system of investing in communities. To reduce offending and reoffending, justice reinvestment includes targeted programs or interventions for communities identified as having high offender rates. {p.27} ~ Strategies aim to reduce the availability of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs, and control their use. Strategies that are effective in this context include indirect price controls by banning cheap high alcohol content beverages such as cask wine, restrictions on trading hours, fewer outlets, dry‐community declarations and culturally sensitive enforcement of existing laws. A petrol sniffing strategy implemented by the Australian Government replacing unleaded petrol with a low aromatic alternative has led to significant reductions in petrol sniffing. {p.12} ~ See image on page 12: Example Strategies: Price controls, Restrictions on trading hours, Fewer alcohol outlets, Dry community declarations, Substitution of opal fuel for unleaded petrol, Culturally sensitive enforcement of laws, Community alcohol management plans, Secondary supply legislation laws – purchase age {p.12} ~ Training and resources to support law enforcement agencies to facilitate culturally appropriate responses to AOD use {p.24} ~","Reduction in AOD‐related offending and involvement in the criminal justice system. {National Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander Peoples Drug Strategy, 2014-2019, p.5 & p.34} ~",,N,N,,"Build capacity and capability of the AOD service system, particularly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander‐ controlled services and its workforce, as part of a cross‐sectoral approach with the mainstream AOD services to address harmful AOD use. {p.5}~ Strengthen partnerships based on respect both within and between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, government and mainstream service providers, including in law enforcement and health organisations, at all levels of planning, delivery and evaluation. {p.5}~ Formal agreements between agencies to coordinate services. • Implementation of joint case management strategies. {p.31}~ Number of services undertaking continuous quality improvement {p.33}~ Community devised measures are identified in local level initiatives. {p.33}~ Support is provided to guide disciplined community based work in developing indicators. {p.33}~ Number of culturally and community‐focused diversionary programs available to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and particularly young people (PA 3). {p.35}~ Number of formal agreements between agencies to coordinate services (PA 3). {p.35}~ Implementation of joint case management strategies (PA 3) {p.35}~ Number of services undertaking continuous quality improvement (PA 4). {p.35}~ Community devised measures are identified in local level initiatives (PA 4). {p.35}~ Support is provided to guide disciplined community based work in developing indicators (PA 4). {p.35}~",,,,Not available,Not available,"1,205,000,000,000 USD (2016)",,"National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan 2013 – 2023; Closing the Gap; National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Suicide Prevention Strategy; National Strategic Framework for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples’ Mental Health and Social Emotional Wellbeing (2004-2009); The National Indigenous Law and Justice Framework; National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Workforce Strategic Framework 2011-2015 ; National Guidelines for Medication-Assisted Treatment of Opioid Dependence, 2014 (http://www.nationaldrugstrategy.gov.au/internet/drugstrategy/Publishing.nsf/content/AD14DA97D8EE00E8CA257CD1001E0E5D/$File/National_Guidelines_2014.pdf)",The NDS committed to the development of a National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples’ Drug Strategy in recognition of the unique needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who are impacted directly or indirectly by harmful AOD use. {p.8),

As a result, the Communal Declaration can be considered a more up-to-date elaboration of Belgian policy, rather than a replacement of the earlier document. In this sense, the action points stated in the Federal Drug Policy Note were assessed in terms of the extent to which they had been achieved, with additional steps to be taken, in the Communal Declaration. There are three overarching measures in the Communal Declaration: (i) a global and integrated approach; (ii) scientific research; and (iii) international coherence. Three pillars are used to structure action: (i) prevention, early detection and early intervention; (ii) treatment and harm reduction; (iii) repression (as a last resort). Priorities are focused on different groups within the three pillars, with prevention targeting non-(problematic) users; treatment, risk-reduction and reintegration aimed at problematic users; and repressive measures directed at producers and traffickers. Overall, the Communal Declaration interprets the drugs problem as a public health issue (EMCDDA, http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/countries/belgium#strategyhttp://www.emcdda.europa.eu/countries/belgium#strategy)","http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/countries/belgium#expenditure; Note politique du Gouvernement fédéral relative à la problématique de la drogue (2001}~ Une politique globale et intégrée en matière de drogues pour la Belgique (2010}~ Developments and Trends on Drugs - 2015, https://eurotox.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/Developments-and-trends-on-drugs-2015.pdf; Service enquêtes, mode de vie et maladies chroniques, https://drugs.wiv-isp.be/docs/Documents/Rapport_DROGUES_2014_tma.pdf;","EMCDDA's Metrics to evaluate Belgium: Prevalence of problem drug use (rate/1000), injecting drug use (rate/100) HIV infections new diagnosed (case/million), HIV prevalence %, HCV prevalence %, Drug-related deaths (rate/million), syringes distributed, clients in substitution treatment, all clients, new clients, all clients with known primary drug, new clients with known primary drug, number of reports of offenses, offenses for use/possession; It is important to note that Belgium has 2 seperate drug plans specific to the French and Flemish regions and communities of the country.",

[…] Likewise, the challenges of development and its gaps make it necessary to work on the recovery and strengthening of human and social capital, which is deeply violated by consumption and its unfavorable consequences {p.10}~ It is also necessary to promote the articulation of actions with the country development project, to avoid fragmentation and isolation, to provide transparency in management and to facilitate mechanisms for accountability, to promote constitutional guarantees and to protect the essence of the Social State of Law, based on the effective exercise of the rights of political, civil, economic, social and cultural citizenship, with universal character, for the whole population {p.10}~ From this perspective, public policy in the area of psychoactive substance use, in addition to improving the physical and mental health conditions of those already involved, should aim to alleviate the associated suffering and to develop conditions that allow control over the factors that put at risk the options of life, the development of capacities, the health and the well-being. This means transcending the service delivery approach and engaging in the overall debate on the country's development agenda. An agenda that prioritizes the search for conditions for peace, security and overcoming poverty and inequality. {p.11}~ Social protection, thus understood, seeks to provide means to help the population more effectively manage the risks, and prevent the loss of well-being and depletion in human capital (asset sales, irreversible damages) for the most vulnerable groups, as well as the eventual loss of income due to a multiplicity of risks. To this end, prevention, mitigation and improvement strategies are put in place, and informal, market and public supply systems are energized with the participation of multiplicity of actors, including individuals, households, institutions, levels of government and the market. {p.15}~ Therefore, fostering opportunities for belonging to groups in conditions of vulnerability (prevention), as well as for groups already involved and recovered (mitigation, overcoming) will contribute to the construction and strengthening of social capital and contribute to overcome inequalities {p.16}~ At the same time, it is hoped to optimize the distribution of scarce and finite resources (technical and financial), thus maximizing welfare, and guaranteeing the right of to access all opportunities to prevent, mitigate and overcome the conditions and factors that make the risks and vulnerability to the consumption of SPA more dynamic. {p.18}~ Finally, social inclusion will be used as a tool to prevent, mitigate and, above all, overcome or deal with the ""after effects"" of having an active commitment to alcohol or other substances. {p.19}~ At the macrosocial level, it is proposed to carry out actions of social development, normative, cultural and regulatory deconstruction, control and social responsibility. It is recognized that this is one of the levels in which the greatest challenges are faced, since in many cases structural aspects are difficult to control. However, it is necessary to recognize that one of the factors with greater protective power is the opportunity to develop in a ""pro-social"" environment, sufficiently rewarding, to provide means and resources for the development of assets, to offer a cultural and formal protection that discourages the demand for SPA and protects against harmful effects.  {p.20}~ In the fields of rehabilitation and social inclusion, it is proposed to respond to the difficulties that many entities face for reasons of infrastructure and qualification of human resources, as well as reduce barriers commonly encountered by rehabilitated consumers to reintegrate into social life and productivity. {p.22}~ In addition to intersectoral and interinstitutional coordination and cooperation, as well as families and communities educated and sensitized to the importance of rehabilitation and social inclusion {p.22}~ All this also puts us in a scenario in which political action is based on respect for human and social rights, promoting every action that involves improving social cohesion and the inclusion of groups in vulnerable situations, ensuring access to media and real opportunities for social integration in both prevention and impact responses. {p.25}~ Within an integrated framework of development as a country agenda, social work requires the effective development of networks and synergies between policies and institutions in terms of social welfare, health promotion and strengthening of the aspects that contribute to human and social capital. {p.25}~ Therefore, the exercise of building a policy for the country in the field of social protection implies an inescapable commitment to guarantee rights, the development of capacities and opportunities, the fight against inequity and lack of social integration. This would make a difference in aspects that strongly influence the choice of substance use as a way of life for many children and young people of our country. Any effort in this regard contributes to the promotion and protection of human capital or, in other words and as stated in Law 789 of 2002, to improve the quality of life and reduce the vulnerability of citizens {Política Nacional Para La Reduccíon Del Consumo De Sustancias Psicoactivas Y Su Impacto, 2007, p.10} ~",N,,"In order to mitigate, it is necessary to prioritize the work with:[...] women of reproductive age... {p.22}~ In short, a political practice whose course is the pursuit of human development, the rights approach and the citizen's exercise, as a bet to achieve quality of life, well-being and reduce the conditions of vulnerability to a phenomenon like the consumption of SPA, is clearly demanding {p.10}~ The priority of the Policy will be any use of legal and illegal SPAs […] in pregnant or lactating women, in accordance with the principles of Social Protection and legislation. {p.17}~",N,,"On the other hand, and at the same time, with other countries, Colombia has experienced changes in the internal dynamics of production, traffic and consumption, which has forced to recognize that it is crucial to promote demand control efforts as much as those that control supply {p.8}~ If we want to move towards a more inclusive society, it is urgent to invest in children and young people, so that they have effective access to sources of well-being, security and equality of accumulation of human capital, precisely because exclusion reduces the choice of life and consumption appears as an option for an increasingly important number of young people in our country. {p.11}~ The priority of the Policy will focus on any use of legal and illegal SPAs in minors, as well as pregnant or lactating women, in accordance with the principles of Social Protection and legislation. {p.17}~ The ultimate goal of the policy is to reduce the incidence and prevalence of psychoactive substance use in Colombia and to mitigate the negative impact of consumption on the individual, family, community and society. Its overall objective or purpose is to offer an integrated, participatory, co-responsible, and effective response to the consumption of psychoactive substances and their impact, based on a common ethical, philosophical, conceptual, operational and management framework. {p.18}~ To intervene on a greater number of conditions, and macrosocial, microsocial and personal factors that increase the vulnerability to the consumption of SPA {p.18}~ The Policy proposes a general framework that aims to guide actions in prevention, mitigation,  and overcoming the risks and damages associated with the consumption of alcohol and other substances, with particular emphasis on the aspects defined as a priority object of the Policy: use of SPA In children, abuse of drugs and volatile substances, problem use and dependence on licit and illicit substances {p.18}~ In order to reduce the incidence of SPA consumption in the country, it is necessary to move towards the achievement of the first strategic objective, for which the operational axis of prevention is proposed, and whose goal is to prevent/avoid the onset and abuse of psychoactive substances at any moment of the life cycle. {p.18}~ Reduce the prevalence of consumption and mitigate the negative impact, requires approaching the second strategic objective and, consequently, the development of the operational axes of mitigation and overcoming, whose goals are: to prevent/avoid the progression of those who have already started to consume and transit drugs, to problematic patterns of or dependence (prevalence}~ To prevent those who have already started in consumption, and are at constant risk, of affecting their physical, mental, emotional, family and social health and that, because of their consumption, endanger others (impact}~ And to avoid that those who have surpassed their condition of active consumption by will, and have maintained a lifestyle free of ""drugs"", return to him (prevalence). {p.18}~ These components of health promotion and its sub-components (prevention, health education and health protection) will prevent and mitigate the risks associated with the consumption of alcohol and other substances, provide assistance and care to mitigate and reduce the risks of active and continued consumption and damages already provoked {p.19}~ In the context of social protection, prevention is a strategy to manage social risk more effectively. It is put in place before the risk is manifested and seeks to reduce the likelihood that an adverse shock will affect the health, quality of life and well-being of individuals, households and communities. {p.19}~ Since the goal of the prevention axis is to prevent/avoid the onset and abuse of psychoactive substances at any point in the life cycle, it is necessary to operate on contextual, situational, family and individual conditions or variables that increase risk and vulnerability to the onset and maintenance of licit and illicit substances use. In particular, those that are more predictive of the risk and those that can be intervened with the resources that have or can be enhanced. In the scenario of prevention as risk management, ""legal"" and illicit ""drugs"" exist, so it is necessary to offer the means to ""live"" with them by choosing not to experiment with licit substances at an early stage and, if they come into contact with them, that they do not try the illicit ones (prevention). If they are still in contact with them, that they do not move to patterns that are even more harmful to health and well-being (mitigation and improvement). {p.19}~ The micro-social level aims to work on risk and protection factors from socialization domains fundamental to the individual: the family, the school, the social reference group (peers) and the community in general. Strategies refer to the development and strengthening of the family, fundamental not only because it is a socializing medium par excellence, but also because exogenous crises are recreated inside, reflecting the risk and vulnerability of the environment and weakening its socializing capacities. {p.20}~ Other strategies refer to the construction of support networks in all the vital areas of development of subjects. The Policy recognizes that these are ideal scenarios for the development of prevention, but it also urges a revision of the perspective that limits, for example, the school to being an ""ideal"" ground for prevention, in order to return to its essential role as a socializing sphere and as a constitutive part of the social support network of children, adolescents, families and communities. {p.20}~ However, it is necessary to overcome the ""problematic"" vision of the young person (as proposed by the National Youth Policy), which distances itself from the subject's understanding and knowledge, indispensable for building a shared vision of the world and transforming reality. {p.20}~ The proposed strategies refer to the promotion of personal development and resilience, as well as to the creation of information and service networks, prioritizing social protection to children, adolescents and young people in vulnerable conditions, strengthening formal and informal mechanisms of protection, as well as social networks. This not only seeks to create support environments, but also to provide concrete means for better risk management, free access from barriers for groups with the greatest need. {p.20}~ In order for the strategies and actions of the prevention operative axis to consolidate the fulfillment of the goal, one must: 1) know the reality to be transformed, 2) involve stakeholders in all phases of the process, 3) act on the most predictive variables, promoting development, networking and integration; (4) diversifying and reaching out to all vulnerable groups; (5) continuing and sustaining action over time. The approach to populations and areas responds directly to the concept of vulnerability, which allows a variable approach to groups and people at different times of life. {p.21}~ Mitigation seeks to reduce the negative effects of risks, both before they materialize and when they have already done so and have become ""damaged."" To meet the goals, it is necessary to intervene in the conditions that influence the transition to patterns of greater commitment to consumption, to intervene in the installation of a lifestyle or the occurrence of risks and damages caused by patterns of harmful use to health and excess of self-indulgence, because the consequences are trivialized or because they catalyze sexual behaviors or high-risk use practices. {p.21}~ In other words, intermediate and pre-treatment actions need to be implemented in formal and informal settings (educational, labor, community and health). It is complementary to treatment services, and allows to reduce the risks associated with various patterns of consumption, as well as dependence, in cases where there is still no access to formal treatment for various reasons {p.21}~ At the social level, the policy strategy and health regulatory environments seek to mobilize the necessary, from policies, norms and systems, to remove potential obstacles in effective protection of health and well-being, as well as to facilitate cultural , contextual, normative, institutional or political change that is required. {p.21}~ The strategy of reorienting care and assistance proposes to flexibilize alternatives for care, assistance and welcome ""excluded"" groups from their incorporation into the information, services, assistance and social support networks. To this end, it will be sought to train the existing service networks, so that from the primary and basic care, it is possible to make early identification of problems associated with consumption, make brief interventions and referrals to the formal and informal service networks for the subject {p.21}~ In the same vein, the network strategy at the level of community intervention {see Prevention axis) will be aimed at guiding and assisting those affected to some degree, by the consumption of SPA, as complementary measures to the formal protection mechanisms, which will help reduce the impact of SPA consumption on public health, productivity and human capital. {p.21}~ At the community level, it is proposed to mobilize strategies for the promotion of social capital based on committees for coexistence and reconciliation, as well as for diagnosis and participatory planning and health education at the base, with which it will be possible to actively involve all parties of the community directly or indirectly interested in finding solutions to a problem that not only belongs to those who consume and their families, as well as to mobilize secondary prevention strategies outside the scope of treatment. {p.21}~ At the household level, the strategies described at the community level will provide the family with the means to better manage the risks and damages arising from consumption, and at the individual level, where components already described at other levels also operate {p.21}~ In order to mitigate, it is necessary to prioritize the work with: consumers excluded from any institutions (no schooling, unemployed, displaced, demobilized, etc.), deprived consumers, women of reproductive age, high risk consumers for using substances that offer risk transition to injection or high impact for health and community well-being, and consumers with psychiatric comorbidity. {p.22}~ In the field of treatment, it is proposed to adjust supply to demand and diversify treatment supply by geographical areas, socio-economic strata, genders, patterns of use and co-morbid conditions. It seeks to achieve an ""inclusive"" supply structure for the diversity of alcohol consumers and other substances that do not find answers to their needs in the style of available treatments.  {p.22}~ The strategies of overcoming refer to the treatment, rehabilitation and social inclusion of those who have developed a disorder of dependence to one or several substances, or present a problematic pattern of consumption in the absence of dependency. {p.22}~ The proposed strategies are based on the fulfillment of the objectives of the provision of service policy under the General System of Social Security in Health: 1) improve access to services, 2) improve the quality of care, and 3) Generate efficiency in the provision of services and achieve the financial sustainability of public IPS. {p.22}~ It is urgent to make efforts to expand the benefits plan so that substance-use disorders of high priority substances can be addressed within the system, for which it is proposed to focus and prioritize care in cases of high impact due to the severity of physical dependence, and strong linkage with anomic behaviors or high risk for physical health {p.22}~   It is necessary to mobilize networks and cooperation, in order to obtain means that allow the rehabilitation and social inclusion of the consumer, in which entities belonging to the Social Protection System can contribute to the achievement of the objectives of vocational rehabilitation (SENA) and Physical Family Allowance. {p.22}~ Create registration, monitoring and evaluation models for prevention, mitigation and improvement work. {p.23}~ Research planning should be based on local patterns to prioritize the study of vulnerable groups, the mapping of local and community resources, and the construction of contextualized responses. {p.23}~ One line is to apply high-risk approaches, as well as selective and targeted prevention (focused on groups most in need of vulnerability - not necessarily poverty). Another line proposes to use alternative methodologies, which allows greater control over the variables that need to be intervened to transform reality (management and social action). A final line consists of the creation of mechanisms that allow integrating efforts to act on multiple risk factors, and those  of a more predictable nature. {p.24}~ Broadly speaking, the policy seeks to control the risks associated with the consumption of SPA, to promote the creation of protective and pro-drug-free environments, to integrate actions to optimize the use of resources, to involve the base, so that in addition to living the problem is an integral part of the solution, to base and govern action in ethics and good practice. {p.25}~ The promotion of favorable and protective environment, demands social and cultural transformations, with the participation of all the actors and mediators who have something to contribute to the understanding of reality as well as its transformation, so that a participatory and co-management is possible, as well as an integrative approach. {p.25}~","% of population that has come into contact with an illicit substance at least once in their lifetime (according to the National Mental Health Study 2004) for the adult population, and youth population {p.13}~ % of university students who have come into contact with illicit substances, such as marijuana (National Mental Health Survey, 2004) {p.13}~ Average age of onset that youth comes into contact with illicit substances, such as marijuana and cocaine (National Mental Health Survey, 2004) {p.13}~ Lifetime prevalence (%) of marijuana between 1992-1996, 2002 and 2004 {p.13}~ Lifetime prevalence (%) of cocaine.

As a result, it seeks to articulate an inclusive policy based on improving the income of this population segment, drawing three lines (i) improving access to physical and financial assets, (ii) Developing partnerships to generate economies of scale and (iii) to provide technical assistance to improve productivity. {p.9}~ Similarly, illicit-free zones will be implemented, in order to promote alternative development, rural development and economic integration, so as to protect the environmental asset and expand the legal agricultural frontier, improving the capacity to generate income, and to encourage incentives that discourage the planting of illicit crops. {p.9}~ The table shows that efforts in reducing illicit crops have been oriented towards spraying and manual eradication, accompanied by alternative development programs aimed at promoting culture legality, and generating licit alternatives for agricultural production growers {p.22}~ Regarding the income received by coca growers, some studies have shown that they do not reach the monthly minimum wage. This fact, demonstrates the need to support public and private sectors aimed at generating economic incentives that allow better income for legal rural activities. According to Mejía and Rico (2010), the net daily per capita income of coca leaf sales for 2008 did not exceed $ 3,000; A study by the National Narcotics Bureau and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) showed that per capita of net daily income in the Pacific was $ 6,400. The situation is even more critical if one analyzes the last decade in which, despite a significant reduction in the extent of coca cultivation, the area of influence is maintained with a greater dispersion of the distribution in the lots, causing the involvement of a greater number of peasants in the business with a subsequent decrease of income per family. {p.29}~ Consolidation of illicit free crops regions: Seeks the final eradication, prevention of replanting illicit substance, and avoiding the displacement of the population involved in illicit crops to other regions of the country, by offering different legal alternatives.

Virtually all tablets contain caffeine and other stimulant substances. The remainder contain mostly mixtures of illicit drugs (cocaine, basil***?, methamphetamine) and medications of all kinds, including those of special control, many of which are very addictive.

The strategy should focus on a ""major development to reduce supply and devote greater attention to health to reduce demand "", recognizing the need to use psychotropic and narcotic substances for medical and scientific purposes {p.51}~ Therefore, special attention will be given to: i) the evolution of drug use in the country through strengthening the Single System of Indicators (UI) designed and implemented by the Ministry of Health and the National Narcotics Directorate, ii) expanded coverage in prevention and programs to reduce risk, iii) mitigating the negative effects of consumption and iv) overcoming problematic use. {p.56}~ comprehensive prevention programs about the problems around drugs will be implemented in the education sector, as a privileged stage to avoid linking youth to any of the manifestations of the problematic drugs. {p.56}~ To intervene on a larger number of conditions and macro – micro social and personal factors that increase vulnerability to consumption: 1) Reducing vulnerability to consumption of licit drugs and, illicit SPA, and to control special interventions by integrating the macro- micro social and personal factors that are predictive of consumption. 2) Transforming social and cultural representations and lifestyles that promote abuse and problematic use of alcohol and other SPA and preventing the development of healthy lifestyles. 3) Dynamically, develop, protect and reduce vulnerability to consumption of SPA through community networks, family, youth and labor. 4) Incorporate prevention components of consumption in SPA health programs at schools, friendly health services for adolescents and youth, and Colombia active and healthy. 5) Develop social skills and personal skills that will allow highly vulnerable groups to develop consumer autonomy and improve their coping skills in difficult situations. 6) Implement projects, and achieve sustainable livelihoods that facilitate social and productive inclusion in groups that are highly vulnerable to consumption {p.70}~ There is a need for individuals, households and communities to find timely and comprehensive answers to their needs against drug misuse (information, care and support): 1) Provide timely access to comprehensive physical and mental health services, and to have educational, productive and labor support networks that benefit communities of drug users.

It establishes guidelines or parameters for the eradication of illicit crops, the control of substances used in the processing of narcotics and creates a new institutional infrastructure, more robust than the incipient and rudimentary established in the 1970s. {p.12}~ Article 34, for example, stipulates that property acquired through illicit enrichment to the detriment of the public treasury or with serious deterioration of social morality is stipulated, and Article 35 authorizes the extradition of native Colombians for crimes committed abroad {p.12}~ The table shows that efforts in reducing illicit crops have been oriented at spraying and manual eradication, accompanied by alternative development programs aimed at promoting culture legality, and generating licit alternatives for agricultural production growers {p.22}~ This set of implemented efforts to counter the problem, parallel complementary work to combat armed illegal groups, who profit from the drug trade. {p.22}~ The results of the State in the fight against Criminal Bands of drug traffickers - BACRIM, show the permanent commitment to face all the criminal manifestations and, specifically, to these criminal organizations that have acquired a capacity of organization and affectation that surpasses the traditional models, given its high adaptability and transformation to absorb all kinds of delinquent manifestations, especially those associated with drug trafficking, the very essence of BACRIM. {p.24}~ The security forces have been confronting these criminal organizations, through actions such as: captures, deaths in operational procedures, seizures of arms and drugs, as well as blocking routes for the transportation of drugs and chemical inputs. {p.24}~ Both the National Police as the Armed Forces have the constitutional obligation to combat these organizations decisively, in order to protect the population and ensure the observance of the Constitution and the law {p.25}~ The crucial factors contributing to their decline are forced manual eradication, aerial spraying, seizures of drugs and chemicals used in processing, the public order situation, diseases and pests that attack plantations and alternative development programs. {p.26}~ In compliance with the policy of the eradication of illicit crops, the Colombian state has combined the strategy of aerial spraying, manual eradication, and alternative development {p.27}~ Consolidation of regions that are free of illicit crops: It seeks the final eradication, prevention of replanting and new plantings, and avoiding the splitting of the population involved in illicit crops to other regions of the country, by offering different legal alternatives. Among these regions are the Pilot Knot Plan of Paramillo: South of Córdoba, Bajo Cauca Antioqueño and Southeastern Antioqueño, Plan of Integral Consolidation of the Macarena-Meta. {p.30}~ Containment zones consisting of the joint implementation of preventive and coercive means to prevent the displacement of existing crops to other areas of the national territory, i.e., to respond to the balloon effect. Among these regions are: AntioquiaCórdoba, Bolivar-Caldas, Choco, Nariño-Cauca, Caquetá-Putumayo, Norte de Santander and Meta-Guaviare-Vichada. {p.31}~ Zones with minimal presence of illicit crops that require immediate action to avoid the increase of these crops and to form areas free of this type of crops in the shortest possible time. {p.31}~ The strategy of the Colombian State in this matter is aimed at interrupting the system that allows the production of illicit drugs, a measure that, in addition to having an effect on the amount of drugs produced, increases costs by raising the value of the chemicals, precursors, inputs and goods used in their production. In fact, the controls exercised, the regulations issued and, in general, the interdiction actions carried out, have contributed to this. In this sense, the guidelines of this nature have allowed military, police and judicial authorities to prevent a proportion of these goods from being diverted to the production of narcotic drugs. {p.32}~ In compliance with these guidelines, the Colombian law enforcement authorities conduct daily seizures and immobilization operations of chemical substances used for the extraction and processing of naturally occurring alkaloids. {p.32}~ 
The fact that the use of chemical substances in drug extraction processes is far superior to seizures suggests the need to strengthen operational, administrative and judicial controls on the entry and marketing of chemical substances. As well as investigating and prosecuting corruption cases that limit effective and efficient control of chemicals. {p.33}~ Taking into account that in Colombia for more than 3 decades, drug traffickers have acquired considerable experience in carrying out their drug trafficking activities, national authorities must design strategies that prevent the transition of the production and trafficking of drugs of natural origin to those of synthetic origin. {p.33}~ Given the novelty and complexity for the comprehensive approach to this emerging phenomenon, it is essential to design and implement strategies aimed at shielding the Colombian territory against the establishment of synthetic laboratories and the emergence of groups specialized in traffic. {p.34}~ To carry out this process efficiently, we need to update criminal and administrative regulations related to precursor chemicals and the implementation of training processes aimed at administrators of justice on specific issues such as drugs. Further, it is essential to strengthen forensic capacity to work in coordination with drug observatories to establish early warning systems based on technical evidence, which will serve as an essential tool for more efficient intervention in both demand and supply. {p.34}~ It is necessary to train the interdiction control authorities for the possible technical intervention to production infrastructures, taking into account that the synthesis laboratories demand specialized knowledge for their dismantling, so as to avoid accidents and negative consequences to the environment.  {p.34}~ State policy has been aimed at blocking the transit drug routes, ensuring coordination of these actions meeting the objectives in strengthening strategic security and surveillance of borders (sea, river and land) and air traffic control by means of an adequate definition of roles and responsibilities {p.36}~ technical intelligence should be strengthened as there are lots of national territory, including land and water areas that do not have a Ideal surveillance {p.38}~ In Colombia, the profit obtained from drug trafficking has been decisively attacked through: (i) criminal prosecution for money laundering, (ii) expansion of coverage of the sectors required to report suspicious transactions to the Financial Information and Analysis Unit (Iii) adaptation of the Financial Superintendence to reinforce its actions in the prevention and control of money laundering, (iv) regulation of the professional activity of buying and selling foreign currency and traveler's checks through the Comprehensive System of Prevention and Control of Money Laundering (SIPLA), v) creation of a special group of Judicial Police and investigators made up of the Technical Investigation Corps (CTI), Administrative Department of Security (DAS) and the National Judicial Intelligence Directorate, (vi) actions for the extinction of a domain for the purpose of depriving criminal organizations of the enjoyment of unlawful profits And (vii) strengthening of the extradition process, among others. {p.46}~ Reduce in a systematic and integral way the persistence of the conditions that favor the drug problem in Colombia and mitigate in a sustainable way the adverse consequences. {p.51}~ Promote the active participation of civil society, the international community and of the State to make Colombia a model country in the intervention of the World Drug Problem, by making the production, trafficking and laundering of its benefits unviable, and to reduce the conditions that make it vulnerable to the consumption of psychoactive substances and to improve the responses to its consequences. {p.51}~ Strategies aimed at reducing the supply and demand for drugs must be articulated and mutually reinforcing, keeping a balance between the institutional investment and financial resources allocated to policy control and reduction of drug abuse.

Drug users, especially those injecting and dependent on opiates, have been identified as an important target population for prevention. Formative research has been undertaken with international technical support, and discussions are underway on effective harm reduction approaches. {p.9} ~ . Recent research on most-at-risk adolescents highlights the need for formative research to identify such subgroups and the contextual factors leading to higherrisk behaviours (such as multiple concurrent partners or drug use) so that effective interventions can be designed and implemented. {p.9} ~ In the health sector, prevention services have mixed coverage, and further progress relies on health systems strengthening {p.9} ~ First, maintain and sharpen focus on most-at-risk populations, and scale up to 60-85% coverage; focus on sex workers & clients, MSM, injecting drug users, and their sex partners, and be aware of subgroups within these larger groups {p.9} ~ An important achievement was the establishment of a taskforce on HIV and drug use under the Lao National Commission for Drug Control and Supervision (LCDC) to initiate harm reduction programmes. The challenge for the next five years will be to operationalise the supportive policies and develop sectoral decrees, train law enforcement agencies and service providers on the implications of these policies, and monitor implementation and adherence. {p.11} ~ To maintain the low prevalence and avoid a concentrated epidemic among sex workers, drug users, men who have sex with men and their sexual partners, the challenge is to monitor risk behaviours, understand the predisposing factors to these behaviours, and better identify those sub-groups with the highest risk and vulnerability, and those hardest to reach (for example due to young age, gender or location). This requires strategic information, especially surveillance and formative research. The second challenge is to reach out to most-at-risk populations, many of whom are known not to access public sector health services due to stigma and criminalisation of their behaviours. Therefore, civil society and the private sector may be in a better position to reach out to them. {p.13} ~ Drug users need to be urgently targeted, especially those using opiates, as international evidence indicates that they are prone to injecting. More evidence is needed on the link between Yaba use and HIV risk, before these users are targeted {p.15} ~ Working on drug use. Recognising the potential of a rapid spread of HIV among drug users, CHAS will work closely with the Lao National Commission on Drug Control and Supervision (LCDC) and other partners to design and implement comprehensive services {p.17} ~ The focus for prevention will remain on most-at-risk populations (sex workers, men who have sex with men, drug users and their sex partners), ensuring sufficient coverage to ensure impact on reducing HIV transmission.

This type of treatment is part of the National Risk Reduction Programme in Morocco (“Programme National de Réduction des Risques au Maroc”). […] This type of substitution programme received very positive feedback in 2011. Consequently, the government approved its extension to sever further cities (Oujda, Rabat, Marrakech, Tetouan, Nador, Al Hoceima et Agadir). {p.22}~ Morocco is amongst those countries which do have functioning needle exchange programmes and where opioid substitution therapy is being developed. {p.25}~ A needle exchange programme was also implemented by the National Centre for Addiction Treatment, Prevention and Research.

It punishes both possession and use of substances or plants categorized as a narcotic and the act of facilitating by any means the use of these substances or plants. {p.15}~ Article 8 of this law takes into account addicts’ interests as it does acknowledge the importance of treatment and care of narcotics addicts. Indeed, this Article provides that “criminal prosecution will not be brought if the author of the crime, following a medical exam performed at the request of the Royal Prosecutor, consents to go into treatment for drug addiction for as long as is needed […] and that “the investigating judge can, on the advice of the Royal Prosecutor, compel treatment"" [...] Article 8 also provides for the exceptional possibility, where the defendant is a minor, to “provide treatment in a family setting, and in conformity with the conditions determined by order of the Minister of Justice made after consulting with the Ministry of Health”. However, in practice, the measures provided for in Article 8 are only very rarely implemented {p.15}~ The creation of “clubs de la citoyenneté” constitutes the premises for national action in terms of prevention. Of these clubs, the health club, communication club, theatre club and other clubs for leisure activities have been introduced in schools to be more supportive of students and explain to them the serious dangers of drug abuse. {p.17}~ The Ministry of Health has developed a “social communication strategy for the prevention of drug abuse” covering the period 2008-2012. The objectives of this programme were: 1) Preventing drug addiction amongst young people and vulnerable populations, combined with the promotion of mental wellbeing. 2) Improving the quality of the care available to drug addicts. […] 4) Treating drug addiction and rehabilitating drug users. {p.18}~ The Ministry intends to prevent addictive behaviours and promote a healthy lifestyle, notably by implementing a social communication strategy {p.18}~ A number of Moroccan organisations are also active in the field of drug prevention. This is the case for example of the “Moroccan Society against tobacco and drugs” (“Association marocaine de lutte contre le tabac et les drogues “) which led a number of prevention campaigns throughout the year and the country to raise Moroccan’s awareness of the risks associated with the use of illegal substances. {p.18}~ The Moroccan Ministry of Health’s strategy to tackle addiction is focused on improving the quality of medical care available to addicts, establishing specialised medical consultation units in the different regions, strengthening the care network, creating mobile specialised unites operating from teaching hospitals, and promoting youth healthcare centres offering psychological counselling in Rabat, Beni Mellal, Marrakesh, and Casablanca. {p.22}~ The national 2015-2016 action plan to combat drug addiction provides for the creation of hospital units specialised in addiction issues in Berrechid, Kenitra, El Kelâa Sraghna, and Agadir {p.22}~",the prevalence of drug abuse amongst 15 year olds in 2006 {p.10}~  the prevalence of substance abuse of those over 15 in 2006 {p.10}~ Number of Injecting Drug Users (IDU) in Morocco in 2013 {p.24}~ Number of IDUs injecting heroin in 2013 {p.24),,"Morocco has developed its anti-drug policy based on a strategy focused on reducing offer, curbing both trafficking and demand, and the implementation of measures designed to encourage alternative development {p.10}~ Concretely, this strategy simultaneously stresses police action, the destruction of cannabis crops, including through programmes for the development of alternative crops, and the reduction of demand, which requires the development of economic alternatives, so as to slow the progression of cannabis production in Morocco’s Northern regions {p.10}~ The Moroccan government has thus reinforced police forces in the Rif Mountains and along the Northern sea borders to prevent drug trafficking operations and staff all drug enforcement checkpoints. Government forces now use helicopters, planes, fast ships, mobile backscatter x-ray machines, ultrasound technology, and satellites to combat drug trafficking. {p.11}~ Moreover, Moroccan law provides for a maximum prison sentence of 30 years for drug-related offences, as well as fines for lesser drug-related offences ranging from 15 000 to 60 000 euros. Prison sentences ranging from ten to fifteen years remain the most common sentence for drug traffickers sentenced in Morocco. {p.12}~ Morocco’s policy dictates that it firmly condemn the production and distribution of drugs and money laundering resulting from illegal drug transactions. {p.13}~ Since 2003, Morocco has adopted a series of measures to strengthen the enforcement of its law on money laundering, including the implementation in May 2007 of a further law on money laundering and the creation in Rabat of a Financial Intelligence Unit. This law provides for the obligation to account for suspicious financial transactions by any legally responsible agent, whether public or private, who in the exercise of his functions, executes or facilitates the movement of funds potentially linked to drug trafficking, human trafficking, arms trafficking, corruption, terrorism, tax evasion, or counterfeiting {p.13}~ Law No. 43-05, adopted and implemented in 2007, strengthened the national regulatory framework punishing activities linked to drug trafficking. The Unit can exchange financial intelligence on money laundering and financing terrorism with foreign agencies with similar competences. {p.14}~ The dahir of 3 October 1977 (amended by No. 1993/52) created the National Commission on Narcotics (Commission Nationale des Stupéfiants). This Commission is made up of the various government departments in charge of the medical and social fields or of enforcement.

Against this background, county councils need to continue to develop working methods and raise staff skills {p.48} ~ the number of elderly people with addiction and addiction needs to be addressed in both elderly care and primary care {p.48} ~ In order to counter differences in health it is important to pay attention to the importance of equal treatment regardless of gender and the socio-economic group of the patient. It is also important to pay attention to exposure to violence, as this can have serious health consequences, both in the short and long term. Age and disability need to be taken into account in this context. Knowledge that there is a link between ANDT abuse and being or have been subjected to violence or other forms of abuse needs to increase. {p.48} ~ Collaboration between health and social services and with other actors for cohesive care based on the specific conditions and needs of women and men as well as girls and boys {p.49} ~ Efforts to reach women and men as well as girls and boys in a social and health-related situation as a result of addiction or addiction {p.51} ~ The Government believes that the availability of low-threshold receptacles, such as spray exchange operations, needs to be improved across the country, and has therefore commissioned a departmental memorandum (Ds 2015: 56) containing proposals to remove the requirement that municipalities and county councils jointly apply for the establishment of spray exchanges.[...] Furthermore, it is proposed that the age limit for participating in such activities be reduced from 20 years to 18 years {p.51} ~ Co-operation between the county council's drug-assisted treatment for opiate addiction (LARO) and social services is also needed to provide patients with both medical and psychosocial treatment as well as social support, which are important conditions for achieving good treatment outcomes. {p.51} ~ The Public Health Authority has developed a guide to health promotion and prevention work with hepatitis and HIV for people who inject drugs.

Based on the Commission's mission, the government's goal is to end the impactable health gaps within a generation. The Commission's proposal will relate to the strategic work for sustainable development, both ecologically, economically and socially. {p.32} ~ Co-operation between the county council's drug-assisted treatment for opiate addiction (LARO) and social services is also needed to provide patients with both medical and psychosocial treatment as well as social support, which are important conditions for achieving good treatment outcomes. {p.51} ~",number of visitors who are registered in needle syringe programs that are in contact with social services {p.51} ~,,"Health differences between the sexes should be taken into account throughout the work of the Commission. Other health differences in society should also be taken into account, such as between persons with disabilities, LGBTQ people, persons with a foreign background, persons belonging to national minorities, the Sami people and the rest of the population. {p.33} ~ A group that has composite needs, and does not rarely end up in a particular vulnerability, are people with sexual dysfunction, ie both dependence and mental illness. The principals should aim to provide equal care and support. This means that everyone, regardless of gender and age shall have the same opportunities and rights to exercise influence over the activities. {p.49} ~ The people affected by the efforts of municipalities and county councils have important knowledge and experience to make use of in the drafting of the agreements. User organizations can capture users' experiences and point to shortcomings and key areas of development. Therefore, the law states that, if possible, organizations representing these persons or their related parties should be given the opportunity to comment on the agreements. {p.50} ~ There are also attempts at target group-oriented child health care for mothers who had drug problems during pregnancy, where children are adhered to school age. {p.53} ~",The number of unaccompanied children who are in asylum in Sweden {p.36} ~ number of children that have parents that drink too much alcohol {p.53} ~,,"The overall objective of ANDT policy is a drug-free society, with reduced medical and social damage caused by alcohol and with one reduced tobacco consumption. {p.29} ~ The overall objective of public health policy to create social conditions for good health on equal terms for the entire population applies also to people living in a socially vulnerable situation as a result of addiction. The general preventive work therefore needs to be complemented with efforts to reach this group. Only then can public health goals be achieved. {p.30} ~ In terms of drugs, doping and tobacco, the goal is to reduce all use. {p.30} ~ It is important to take into account gender, age, socioeconomic affiliation and place of residence in all ANDT work, as these factors are crucial for whether or not prevention measures will be effective. {p.31} ~ It is therefore of strategic importance to have knowledge of the factors that affect addiction and how they differ in terms of men and women. Both regarding the occurrence of addiction and its effect on health {p.31} ~ The Government believes that both gender and gender equality should be systematically taken into account in both the implementation and follow-up of the ANDT strategy. It is important that health promotion and preventive ANDT efforts focus on addressing gender differences and respond to gender-based individual and / or group-specific needs and conditions, as well as taking into account other socio-economic or demographic differences with regard to ANDT consumption or harmfulness to followed by ANDT. To support such work, the indicator system needs to be developed, partly to ensure that all statistics are gender-segregated and that it supports the follow-up of developments in different socio-economic and demographic groups (see section Development of Organization for Implementation).{p.31} ~  In order to strengthen the child's development, health and rights, the government has therefore set a goal that all parents should be offered universally and directed support in parenthood and in their relationship to each other during the child's entire upbringing. The county councils have the task of supporting municipalities, county councils and other parents supporting actors in the years 2014-2017 in developing a universal, knowledge-based, coordinated and long-term support for parents with children in their teens. {p.34} ~ The Government believes that it is important for initiatives that make it easier for girls and boys to pursue active leisure, especially for the most vulnerable children in society. The fact that young people have access to activities that give them meaningful free time can both postpone debut and prevent abuse of alcohol and drugs. The government's ambition is for children and young people to have better opportunities to participate in sports, outdoor activities and cultural schools. {p.35} ~ The government also allocates SEK 80 million per year to 2016 to introduce free entrance to state museums as well as 230 million to cultural activities in the million program areas, as well as SEK 400 million for the years 2015-2018 to make the municipal music and culture school more accessible. The government has also allocated additional funds 2016 for child and youth sports activities. {p.36} ~ Objective 1: Access to alcohol, drugs, dopants and tobacco should be reduced. {p.36} ~ Objective 2: The number of children and young people who start using drugs, dopants and tobacco or debut early with alcohol should gradually decrease. {p.36} ~ Objective 3: The number of women and men as well as girls and boys who develop malicious use, addiction or addiction to alcohol, drugs, dopants or tobacco should gradually decrease. {p.36} ~ Objective 4: Women and men as well as girls and boys with addiction or addiction should, according to their conditions and needs, have increased accessibility to quality care and support. {p.36} ~ The number children and young people who start using drugs, dopants and tobacco or debut early with alcohol should gradually decrease {p.37} ~ Against this background, the government sees strong reasons for taking action such as aims to enable faster classification of such hazardous substances which occurs on the Swedish market. {p.40} ~ The work is aimed at strengthening the social security network around the young person by coordinating support for social services, schools and police. An important part of the social action groups is to make young people aware of the risks of drugs and non-drug-based preparations. This crime prevention work therefore also has a clear ANDT prevention effect. {p.43} ~ It is important to strengthen prevention efforts through information and increased knowledge in sports-related environments to prevent the use, sale and distribution of mainly doping preparations. Efforts need to be coordinated to become more effective. {p.43} ~ A health promotion school is based on the students' different conditions and needs {p.45} ~ Completing the school is also the single most important factor for children's future health. Therefore, a safe school environment with well-functioning teaching as well as a preventive and health-promoting student health is of great importance to children's and young people's health development. {p.45} ~ Collaboration between school and parents as well as parents ability to engage in school, their expectations of the child and ability to support and encourage the child in school work are important for school results, health and well-being. By supporting the parents in this, the conditions for good school performance can be improved. {p.45} ~ The county councils have the government's mission to support municipalities, county councils and other parents supporting actors in the development of a universal, knowledge-based, coordinated and long-term support for parents with children in their teens in their respective countries. {p.45} ~ The National School of Education has the task of developing and implementing national school development programs aimed at principals and schools.52 The efforts relate to skills development and support efforts and include working methods and working methods to develop work on the school's value base, which includes security, study, anti-discrimination and abuse, and work for gender equality and norm criticism.  {p.45} ~ the government gave a special investigator the task of identifying pupils' problematic absence in elementary school. The investigator will also analyze the reasons for the absence and suggest how the school's work to promote attendance and take action in the absence can be improved. {p.46} ~ The government has also taken a number of measures to improve the results for school pupils {p.46} ~ The government's actions to improve school outcomes, to develop the school's value-based work and to strengthen and develop student health create the overall prerequisites for a health promotion school for all students, including for the prevention of ANDT. {p.46} ~ The aim was to promote a common preventive work against cannabis use among others, through skills-enhancing efforts among those working with young people and in care and treatment {p.47} ~ At the same time, the Public Health Agency was commissioned to compile research findings and evaluations of implemented drug abuse efforts and with a particular focus on cannabis abuse. It is also included in the mission to disseminate experiences and information on effective methods and strategies in terms of prevention as well as early action. The dissemination of knowledge shall primarily take place in municipalities, county councils and the non-profit sector. {p.47} ~  The County Councils ANDT Coordinators and the process leaders for developing addiction and addiction care provide important resources to support the municipalities and the county council's addiction and addiction care in its development of activities in the field of cannabis use and addiction, especially among children and young people. {p.47} ~ Attention and prevention of ANDT-related ill health among women and men as well as girls and boys in health care, social services and other venues {p.47} ~  Reduce the use and availability of anabolic androgenic stereos (AAS) and other doping preparations among training institutions. {p.48} ~ It is important for increased coordination in preventive work to come about among different actors to effectively combat doping in the athletic race {p.49} ~ Within the context of the ANDT strategy, it is essential that there is continued development work that contributes to available quality care and treatment. {p.49} ~ Care and support for people with addiction and addiction is a shared responsibility for county councils and municipalities. Since 1 July 2013, county councils and municipalities have been obliged to conclude agreements for cooperation with alcohol, drug, drug and doping users {p.49} ~ Early attention to risk use and dependence among prospective parents {p.52} ~ Damage to children caused by alcohol, drugs, doping or tobacco can never be accepted. Efforts to protect children against harmful use of others and others constitute a continuing basis for the health promotion and prevention of the ANDT work. {p.52} ~  In order to further increase knowledge, the state's medical and social evaluation (SBU) preparation will provide a knowledge overview of methods for investigation, diagnosis and support for children with FAS / FASD. It may provide a basis for obtaining guidance or similar in the field. {p.53} ~ Strengthened child and parent perspective in drug addiction {p.54} ~ Strategic and long-term work to counter drug-related issues mortality among women and men as well as girls and boys {p.54} ~ In order to counteract the increasing drug-related mortality, it may be motivated that the principals develop their efforts to better capture people in the risk zone, motivate and offer attractive and easily accessible support and treatment efforts. {p.55} ~","Prevalence of pupils in elementary school year and upper secondary school that have used an NPS at somepoint. {p.40} ~ Trends of cannabis use among young people {p.47} ~ use of doping preparations, drugs and supplements in training facilities in 2014. {p.48} ~ prevalence of doping {p.48} ~ number of men reporting that they have doped in the last 12 months {p.49} ~ Prevalence of coaches who agree fully or partially with the statement ""It's important that the gym I work on actively works to counter doping."" {p.49} ~ Prevalence of trainers who stated that they had noted the 100 percent pure hard training logo. {p.49} ~ Since 2010, there is also a statutory obligation for the principals to offer the persons who need intervention from both principals a coordinated individual plan (Chapter 2, Section 7, SoL and Section 3 of the HSL). [...] In open comparisons in 2014, prevalence of municipalities reported that they have procedures to inform the individual about the right to get such a plan. {p.50} ~",,"This means that restrictions on personal freedom can be accepted for public health protection, such as expressed in strong support for the Swedish alcohol monopoly, age limits for the purchase of alcohol and tobacco, as well as the criminalization of drugs and doping {p.29} ~ Combating illegal trafficking and a restrictive and clearly regulated and legal trade through digital media {p.40} ~ the Police Office established a national IT crime center aimed at strengthening the police's work against IT-related crime at large. The Center also has the task of handling method development and assisting with some expert competence. This will strengthen the police's ability in counteracting drug trafficking, non-drug-based drugs and doping on the Internet. {p.40} ~  Collaboration between ANDT Prevention and Crime Prevention on all levels {p.41} ~ The government has initiated an effort to develop the wide-ranging crime prevention work. As a first step, Brå has submitted proposals for how local crime prevention work can be strengthened and developed through improved national coordination. The assignment is based on an analysis of local needs and conditions in which the need for enhanced regional involvement in crime prevention work, for example by county administrative boards, is considered. The goal is to have structured crime prevention work throughout the country. {p.42} ~ Furthermore, the Government intends to develop a national strategy for crime prevention work covering a wide range of measures during the term of office. It can be social interventions for those at high risk of getting into or returning to crime but also reducing the likelihood that crimes are committed by making the crimes less profitable, more risky or harder to perform. {p.42} ~ The Government has also instructed the Swedish Customs, Police, ECO and Tax Agency to map how authorities work to prevent illegal handling of excisable goods is conducted and analyze how cooperation can be improved. The aim is to create better opportunities for the authorities to ensure that excise duty legislation is not circumvented and handle extensive cheating. {p.42} ~  The work is aimed at strengthening the social security network around the young person by coordinating support for social services, schools and police. {p.43} ~ The prosecution service has been given the government's responsibility to develop and strengthen the agency's work on emissions in order to increase the client's ability not to return to crime. {p.50} ~","Trends of NPS trades, and sales of drug based preparations {p.40} ~ number of drug traffickers {p.55} ~",,"Objective 6: A public health-based view of ANDT within the EU and internationally. {p.36} ~ Actively promoting a public health-oriented view of drugs within the EU and the UN based on human rights policy {p.56} ~ A specific target area relates to improving efforts globally to prevent and provide care and treatment for people in addiction {p.56} ~ The Swedish Government attaches great importance to the need to improve the balance between efforts, so that the main objective, health protection and health improvement will be even more prominent in the policy area. {p.57} ~ The Government intends to work for the EU's development of a new Action Plan for Drugs 2017 to reflect a public health-based drug policy based on human rights. Sweden will also work in EU cooperation to make the EU's voice on these issues clearer in various UN agencies, UN reports and strategies. Sweden will at the High Level Meeting held at the General Assembly in April 2016 and in subsequent work ensure that a public health policy also forms the basis for the follow-up of the Political Declaration that will take place in 2019. {p.57} ~ WHO should work out and adopt a broad public health policy response to drug issues before 2019 {p.57} ~ A public health policy perspective therefore allows for a comprehensive approach and promotes a balanced international response to the drug issue. WHO's normative guidance also sets international standards. These affect both Sweden and other countries. {p.58} ~ Develop drug issues in global development cooperation {p.58} ~ International work against doping based on sport {p.58} ~ Sweden has ratified two conventions against doping in sport, the International Convention against Doping in the Council of Europe and the International Convention Against Doping in Unesco. Both Conventions as a basis to counter health risks of doping and cheating in sport. Swedish Sports Confederation and Cabinet Office is continuing work on the conventions. Within the Monitoring Group of the Council of Europe Convention, work is constantly under way to develop qualitative methods in anti-doping and to ensure the obligations of the Convention Parties in the Convention. Sweden and other member states of the EU and the Council of Europe, together with the sports movement, also participate in developing international work against doping in the World AIDS Organization (WADA) sport, including by contributing annually to financing the organization's budget. {p.58} ~ Within the ANDT area there are several forums for cooperation and exchange of experience between the Nordic countries. In many respects, the Nordic countries are equal, creating good opportunities to learn from each other. In other respects, politics differ, which also provides the opportunity to compare how different policy choices affect development. Nordic cooperation also provides the conditions for jointly driving issues to gain greater weight in other EU co-operation and international cooperation. {p.59} ~",N,,N,,,,Not available,Not available,"511,000,000,000 USD (2016)",,A presentation that summarises the ANDT strategy (in English) - http://www.government.se/49a303/contentassets/5538b583fd3745d8ac905799565b54c6/presentation-of-the-strategy-for-alcohol-narcotics-doping-and-tobacco-andt-for-the-period-20162020.pdf; The ANDT strategy from 2010-2015 http://www.government.se/49b757/contentassets/0e3caf84b1ff4a038ec70c3c9c4db2ac/a-cohesive-strategy-for-alcohol-narcotic-drugs-doping-and-tobacco-andt-policy.-s.2011.02,,

In the residential sector, therapy and counseling are essentially referring to the care offered by socio-therapeutic institutions as well as psychiatric and acute somatic care provided by psychiatric institutions and hospitals. In addition, professional integration, self-help (eg, Alcoholics Anonymous), aftercare, volunteer assistance and specific offers (eg prescription treatment for addictions in case of dependence Opiates or smoking cessation) also play an important role. {p.17}~ Psychosocial support in case of addiction is changing. In particular, the FOPH focuses its efforts on promoting the conceptual and technical development of offers in this field and, in the spirit of co-ordinating the health course, on strengthening collaboration with the medical and psychiatric field. {p.18}~ the FOPH encourages coordination and exchange between the actors of psychosocial and socio-therapeutic support in cases of addiction, and of post-cure follow-up and medical-psychiatric care. {p.18}~ The objective of the offers developed at the time - easily accessible contact and reception centers, needle exchange, opiate substitution and heroin prescribing, low-threshold facilities and supportive housing - was to enable the persons in question to free themselves from social exclusion, in order to preserve their chances of being able one day to undergo therapy. Today, risk reduction is no longer focused solely on heroin addicts in a situation of exclusion. It is also aimed at people who are integrated into society but who are exposed to significant damage or problems by consuming psychoactive substances or by borrowing money. {p.20}~ Reduction of risks and damages: Behaviors linked to addictions have less negative consequences for the individual, his entourage and society {p. 20}~ The cantons, municipalities and private institutions have therefore begun to broaden the concept of reducing risks not only to all forms of addiction but also to the potentially harmful use of psychoactive substances. {p.20}~ Mostly applied to illegal substances so far, the risk reduction approach - which consists of limiting damages linked to risky behavior and setting up offers that are not accessible only to abstinents - must be extended to all forms of addiction where this seems appropriate and necessary. {p.21}~ Prevention of communicable diseases: the FOPH encourages the exchange of knowledge and experience in the prevention, diagnosis, detection and treatment of communicable diseases (hepatitis B and C, HIV), and will prepare recommendations on these subjects with the assistance of specialists {p.21}~  by institutionalizing the exchange of knowledge and experience via specialized networks, the FOPH supports the cantons, municipalities and institutions in managing their low-threshold offers (eg Stay and consumption, needle exchange, job offers, housing solutions) and encourages the development of new instruments and methods (eg Drug Checking). {p.21}~ The FOPH is working with specialized companies to disseminate a concept to strengthen the teaching of addiction medicine in the basic training of doctors. {p.33}~",N,,"The objective of promoting health and prevention is also present in certain measures to promote equal opportunities, for example, combating poverty, preventing and combating violence (domestic violence), support for disadvantaged children and adolescents, as well as other integration measures. {p.14}~ Reduction of risks and damages: Behaviors linked to addictions have less negative consequences for the individual, his entourage and society {p.20}~ Risk reduction measures also affect other issues, such as violence and accidents related to the consumption of psychoactive substances and their negative impacts on the environment, in particular for family members. {p.20}~",N,,"The objective of promoting health and prevention is also present in certain measures to promote equal opportunities, for example, combating poverty, preventing and combating violence (domestic violence), support for disadvantaged children and adolescents, as well as other integration measures {p.14}~ To realize the objectives of therapy and counseling, it is also important to exploit the possibilities offered by the Internet, in particular in terms of interactivity, which can complement the offers of direct care and reach a wider audience {p.17}~ The promotion of interinstitutional and interprofessional collaboration as well as with stakeholders in other fields such as vocational integration, disability insurance, education, migration or integration is also an important aspect {p.17}~ optimization and promotion of the use of new technologies in prevention and counseling {p.18}~ In addition to measures to strengthen individual responsibility, the FOPH promotes a health-friendly framework, and works to raise awareness for measures not only used in health policy but also in other policy areas ( Eg, economics, education, infrastructure) that may have an impact on the population's addiction behavior. {p.23}~ the FOPH supports efforts to increase the awareness of continuing education institutions on the themes of migrants and people with a precarious socio-economic status. It is also a question of sensitizing them to the importance of integrating these themes in an appropriate treatment of the addictions {p.33}~ The Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) assists Infodrog and the specialized associations, in the development of continuing training offers for occupational groups concerned with addiction problems, such as professionals in social fields, education and integration fields, or gambling industry providers. {p.33}~",N,,"The National Hospice Palliative Care Strategy hopes to increase efforts to improve the coordination of care for elderly patients with addiction {p.6}~ Strengthening health promotion and prevention among the elderly {p.10}~ Sensitization of groups at risk {p.11}~ Thirdly, the elderly, whose priorities lie in the preservation of autonomy and quality of life and in the prevention of disability and dependence on care. {p.14}~ Early intervention is an approach that seeks to prevent stigma and builds on the resources of the individual {p.16}~ Strengthen health promotion and prevention among the elderly {p.16}~ The FOPH strengthens its action in the field of health promotion for the elderly.

It ensures that these activities are aligned with those of the National Dementia Strategy, the National Hospice Palliative Care Strategy and coordinated care. It places particular emphasis on already existing risk behaviors, which can intensify as a result of difficult personal events. {p.16}~ Prison health: in conjunction with other federal offices and relevant cantonal conferences, the FOPH supports prison health actors in their efforts to enforce the principle of equivalence, to provide the same care as the rest of the population.

Secondly, adults, whose main aim is to preserve health, avoid diseases, and preserve and develop their place in social and economic life. {p.14}~ The objective of promoting health and prevention, is also present in certain measures to promote equal opportunities, for example, [...] offers of support for disadvantaged children and adolescents and other integration measures. {p.14}~ Strengthen health promotion and prevention among children and adolescents {p.15}~The FOPH helps health promotion actors in schools and umbrella youth associations design and implement child and adolescent-friendly prevention projects to strengthen their health skills. In consultation with the actors, it develops the bases for the promotion of the health for children and adolescents, taking into account their main living environments (family, school and training, leisure). (P15}~ The primary objective here is to ensure, in collaboration with employers, that employees have access to health promotion opportunities. {p.15}~ The FOPH is reinforcing its commitment to early intervention, in order to quickly identify adverse developments, conditions and risky behaviors. [...]. Priorities in this area are the exchange of experiences, awareness-raising, and continuing education of professionals in the field of addictions, and professionals who are occasionally confronted with problems of addiction {p.16}~ Online consultation via SafeZone.ch: in conjunction with the cantons and the consulting institutions, the Federal Office for Public Health (FOPH) is continuing to develop the SafeZone.ch online consultancy portal and acts to anchor advice and information on the Internet and Virtual network between professionals throughout Switzerland. The FOPH encourages the development of information specific to addictions (eg via www.praticien-addiction.ch) and works on the dissemination of online self-management tools (eg self-tests ). {p.18}~ The FOPH supports the actors of primary care medicine in early intervention and the treatment of addictions by preparing the knowledge required for this purpose and making them available to them. {p.19}~ Knowledge transfer: knowledge acquired through monitoring and research is analyzed and made available to all stakeholders through congresses, publication of information on the Internet or e-mails {p.32}~ Promotion of practical tools: the FOPH supports efforts to continue to disseminate, in particular through awareness-raising among training institutions, the tools and methods available for dealing with addiction issues. For example, the FOPH supports the dissemination of the method of ""motivational interviewing"", which helps to stimulate behavior change in order to better manage his own health. {p.33}~ The prevention of health risks through information is one of the main tasks of cantonal and national health authorities. The FOPH continues to support cantons and addiction associations in their efforts to raise public awareness of addiction problems and publish information on its website. {p.34}~ Professionals and the public are actively informed about addiction issues and general health conditions. Risk factors are highlighted {p.35}~",N,,"Creation and development of an addiction monitoring system {p.11}~ Drug Market Analysis and Progress Reporting {p.11}~ regulating markets for psychoactive substances {p.22}~ the FOPH creates the necessary conditions for the cantons, municipalities and other executive bodies to exchange experiences on the implementation of legal provisions related to the issue of addictions. {p.23}~ Establishment of the list of narcotic drugs: exchanges between health and customs authorities are intensified regarding the preparation of the list of illegal substances and the seizure of narcotic drugs {p.24}~ in cooperation with the cantonal police forces and other actors, fedpol monitors developments in the drug markets, in particular developments in the field of drug trafficking. {p.32}~ fedpol contributes to the implementation of the National Strategy Addictions essentially in two ways: by following the evolution of the situation on the markets for narcotic drugs, and by exchanging it with the other actors concerned, in particular with federal authorities as The FOPH and the AFD. {p.32}~",N,,"Representation of Switzerland's interests and exchange of experience and knowledge at the international level {p.11}~ the FOPH sets up a monitoring system using existing data sources (eg the Swiss Health Survey, police crime statistics, hospital medical statistics or wastewater analysis) (Eg Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey or the act-info treatment statistic). In doing so, it ensures compliance with international standards so that this system is most compatible with international surveys such as the European Drugs Report. {p.32}~ Switzerland actively participates in international efforts to strengthen public health and privileges the international exchange of experience and knowledge. The Swiss foreign policy on health, which is the instrument guaranteeing coordination between the health policy, external policy and development cooperation policy objectives, is an important guide for its implementation. {p.37}~ Switzerland defends its interests and the objectives of the National Strategy Addictions in intergovernmental organizations or organizations (UN, WHO, UNODC, EU, Council of Europe, OECD). This includes both legally binding conventions (in the areas of illegal drugs and tobacco) and its collaboration with international strategies, action plans and the follow-up committees, and recommendations emanating from them (particularly in the fields of narcotics, Alcohol and tobacco). {p.37}~ on request or on its own initiative, the FOPH organizes and maintains bilateral and multilateral contacts on the policy of addictions with governmental representations and foreign delegations. {p.37}~ Switzerland actively participates in the work of international bodies or working groups which play an important role in the exchange of experience and knowledge. The FOPH makes the information acquired in this framework available to its national partners. {p.37}~ Switzerland implements commitments made at the international level, and coordinates its action with international strategies, action plans and recommendations. It processes the knowledge gained through its international relations so that it can be integrated into its national bodies and processes. {p.37}~",N,,,,,,4.5 million francs {p.45),not available,"670,789,930,000 USD (2015)",,All additional documents have their own row,"A report evaluating the policy is planned to be published in 2020, and a final report in 2024 {p.47)",
