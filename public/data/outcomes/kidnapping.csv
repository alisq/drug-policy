Burundi,," Kidnapping means unlawful detainment and taking away of a person or persons against their will (including through the use of force, threat, fraud or enticement) for the purpose of demanding an illicit gain, any other economic gain or other material benefit for their liberation, or in order to oblige someone to do or not to do something. Kidnapping should include 'express kidnapping' for short periods of time but should exclude abduction of a minor in the context of disputes over child custody.","When using the figures, any cross-national comparison should be conducted with caution because of the differences that exist between the legal definitions of offences in countries, the different methods of offence counting and recording and differences in the share of criminal offences that are not reported to or detected by law enforcement authorities (i.e. the dark figure).",https://data.unodc.org/#state:19
