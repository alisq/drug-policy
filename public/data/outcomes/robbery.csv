Burundi,43.57,41.94,39.25,41.56,,"“Robbery” means unlawfully taking or obtaining property with the use of force or threat of force against a person with intent to permanently or temporarily withhold it from a person or organization. ""Robbery"" should include theft with violence from the person (mugging, bag-snatching with force), robbery of valuables or goods in transit, of an establishment or institution, of livestock and other acts of robbery involving the use of force against a person. ""Robbery"" should exclude theft without violence (pick pocketing), ""Burglary"" and extortion.","When using the figures, any cross-national comparison should be conducted with caution because of the differences that exist between the legal definitions of offences in countries, the different methods of offence counting and recording and differences in the share of criminal offences that are not reported to or detected by law enforcement authorities (i.e. the dark figure).",https://data.unodc.org/#state:5
