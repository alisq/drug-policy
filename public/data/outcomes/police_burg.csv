Kenya,4.52,4.29,3.61,3.1,3.06,"“Burglary” means gaining unauthorized access to a part of a building/dwelling or other premises with or without the use of force against the building/dwelling, with intent to commit theft or when actually committing theft. “Burglary” should include, breaking and entering business premises (office buildings, shops, clubs, banks factories, hotels etc); residential premises (house, appartment or other dwelling place that is the habitual place of residence of the victim); or public premises owned, rented or leased by public bodies. ""Burglary"" should exclude theft from a car, container, vending machine, parking meter and from a fenced meadow/compound.","When using the figures, any cross-national comparison should be conducted with caution because of the differences that exist between the legal definitions of offences in countries, the different methods of offence counting and recording and differences in the share of criminal offences that are not reported to or detected by law enforcement authorities (i.e. the dark figure).",https://data.unodc.org/#state:1
