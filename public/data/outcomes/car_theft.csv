Kenya,3.06,2.82,2.65,2.76,2.41," “Theft of a Motorized Land Vehicle” means the theft of a motorized land vehicle. 'Motorized land vehicle' means all land vehicles with an engine that run on the road, including cars, motorcycles, buses, lorries, construction and agricultural vehicles. ""Theft of a motorized land vehicle"" should exclude the illegal use of a motorized land vehicle with intent to temporarily deprive it from the owner ('joyriding').","When using the figures, any cross-national comparison should be conducted with caution because of the differences that exist between the legal definitions of offences in countries, the different methods of offence counting and recording and differences in the share of criminal offences that are not reported to or detected by law enforcement authorities (i.e. the dark figure).
