Burundi,,8.57,6.49,7.46,,"""Theft” means unlawfully taking or obtaining of property with the intent to permanently withhold it from a person or organization without consent and without the use of force, threat of force or violence, coercion or deception. “Theft” excludes ""Burglary"", ""Robbery"", and ""Theft of a Motorized Land Vehicle"", which are recorded separately.","When using the figures, any cross-national comparison should be conducted with caution because of the differences that exist between the legal definitions of offences in countries, the different methods of offence counting and recording and differences in the share of criminal offences that are not reported to or detected by law enforcement authorities (i.e. the dark figure).",https://data.unodc.org/#state:4
