Burundi,," ""Serious Assault"" means the intentional or reckless application of serious physical force inflicted upon the body of a person resulting in serious bodily injury. Serious physical force, at minimum, includes being shot, stabbed, cut, hit by an object or poisoned. ""Serious Assault"" should exclude the application of minor physical force (such as hitting, slapping or pushing), resulting in no injury or minor bodily injury. ""Sexual assault"", ""Threat"" and ""Assault leading to death"" should also be excluded.",": When using the figures, any cross-national comparison should be conducted with caution because of the differences that exist between the legal definitions of offences in countries, the different methods of offence counting and recording and differences in the share of criminal offences that are not reported to or detected by law enforcement authorities (i.e. the dark figure).",https://data.unodc.org/#state:20
