Kenya,,,,,," “Persons Convicted” means persons found guilty by any legal body authorized to pronounce a conviction under national criminal law, whether or not the conviction was later upheld. The total number of persons convicted should also include persons convicted of serious special law offences but exclude persons convicted of minor road traffic offences, misdemeanours and other petty offences.","When using the figures, any cross-national comparison should be conducted with caution because of legal and procedural differences that exist across national criminal justice systems.",https://data.unodc.org/#state:7
