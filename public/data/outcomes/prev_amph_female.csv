United Kingdom (England and Wales),2015/16,0.4,,"Except where the prevalence values are taken from household surveys, changes between years need to be interpreted with caution as they might reflect a change in the methodology or the data source from which the estimate was derived and therefore should not be considered as a change in prevalence. Where a country has reported a combined prevalence for amphetamines and other stimulants these have been reported under ""Amphetamines"" and a flag included to state if this includes prescription stimulants. Where a combined prevalence has not been reported by the Member State and the prescription stimulant prevalence is known, this has been reported under ""Prescription stimulants"".Â
