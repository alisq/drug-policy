Kenya,2011,0.21,n/a,"The numbers of PWID reported are taken directly from the source document. The prevalence of injecting drug use is also taken directly from the source document where this is stated, otherwise it has been calculated by UNODC using the population aged 15-64 for the year of the survey (using population data from the UN World Population Prospects). For some countries no information on the number of PWID was reported, only an estimate of the prevalence of injecting drug use.",https://data.unodc.org/#state:37
